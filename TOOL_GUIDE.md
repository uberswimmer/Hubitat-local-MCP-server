# MCP Tool Guide

Detailed reference for MCP Rule Server tools. Consult this when tool descriptions need clarification.

## Category Gateway Proxy (v0.8.0+)

As of v0.8.0, the server uses **domain-named gateways** to organize lesser-used tools behind gateway tools. The MCP `tools/list` shows 36 items (13 core + 23 gateways) covering 116 total tools. Use `hub_search_tools` to find any tool by natural language query.

**How to use a gateway:**
1. Call the gateway with no arguments to see full parameter schemas for all its tools
2. Call with `tool='<tool_name>'` and `args={...}` to execute a specific tool

Gateway verbs encode mutation: **`hub_read_*`** gateways are pure-read (every sub-tool read-only), **`hub_manage_*`** gateways contain at least one write. A read tool may appear in BOTH a `hub_read_*` gateway and a mixed `hub_manage_*` gateway (multi-membership).

**Read gateways (8):** `hub_read_apps_code` (11), `hub_read_dashboards` (2), `hub_read_devices` (5), `hub_read_diagnostics` (8), `hub_read_files` (2), `hub_read_rooms` (2), `hub_read_rules` (6), `hub_read_variables` (3)

**Manage gateways (15):** `hub_manage_backup` (4), `hub_manage_code` (10), `hub_manage_custom_rules` (8), `hub_manage_dashboards` (6), `hub_manage_destructive_ops` (4), `hub_manage_devices` (9), `hub_manage_diagnostics` (7), `hub_manage_files` (4), `hub_manage_logs` (5), `hub_manage_mcp` (1), `hub_manage_native_rules_and_apps` (11), `hub_manage_radio` (6), `hub_manage_rooms` (5), `hub_manage_rule_machine` (11), `hub_manage_variables` (8)

All safety gates are preserved: the Read/Write master gate runs centrally in `executeTool()` and re-applies per sub-tool when a gateway routes back through it, and the destructive `confirm`+backup checks run in the handlers of the destructive write tools.

### Disabling Gateways (Flat Tool List)

Gateways exist because most MCP clients struggle with long tool lists. Some clients now ship their own progressive-disclosure layer (deferred tools, built-in BM25 search, etc.) and don't need ours. For those, the **Consolidate tools behind category gateways** setting in the app preferences can be turned off — `tools/list` then advertises every tool individually and `hub_search_tools` is suppressed because it's only useful for navigating gateway-hidden tools.

When the toggle is off, the dispatch contract still holds: every gateway sub-tool already has its own case in `executeTool()`, so a flat-mode client calling `hub_list_rooms` directly hits the same handler as a gateway-mode client calling `hub_manage_rooms` with `tool: "hub_list_rooms"`. If a stale or cached client tries to call a gateway name (e.g. `hub_manage_rooms`) while the toggle is off, the server returns a soft `isError` pointing at the underlying sub-tools rather than silently servicing the call with a gateway-shaped response.

Default is **ON** (gateways enabled). Existing installations keep the gateway behavior on update. Counts here describe the shipped catalog; runtime `tools/list` size varies based on enabled settings (the Read/Write masters, the Custom Rule Engine, the gateway toggle, and any Advanced per-tool/per-gateway overrides all add or remove entries).

### Permission Model

Every tool is gated by two universal masters, **Read** and **Write**, both **ON by default**:

- **Read** (`enableRead`) exposes every read-only / non-destructive tool. With it OFF, those tools vanish from `tools/list` and `hub_search_tools`, and a cached call is rejected: "Read tools are disabled…".
- **Write** (`enableWrite`) exposes every state-changing tool. With it OFF, those tools vanish, and a cached call is rejected: "Write tools are disabled…".

Enforcement is central: one classification gate at the top of `executeTool()` checks each tool against `getReadOnlyToolNames()`. Only an explicit OFF blocks (unset = ON). Gateway *names* aren't classified here — they route back through `executeTool()`, which gates each sub-tool on re-entry. The destructive write tools additionally require `confirm=true` + a backup within 24h (the `confirm`+backup tier below), independent of the Write master.

**Advanced: Per-tool Overrides (#114, deny-only).** Under the app's Advanced settings, `disabled_tools` / `disabled_gateways` can switch off individual tools or whole gateways **below** the masters — they only turn things OFF, never re-enable. A disabled tool (or every tool inside a disabled gateway, including tools shared across gateways) drops from `tools/list` and `hub_search_tools`, and a cached call returns a **distinct** error: "…is disabled in Advanced settings (Per-tool Overrides)…". A disabled tool stays documented in `hub_get_tool_guide` — only its discoverability/dispatch is removed, not its reference.

### `tools/list` Returns the Full Catalog in One Response

`tools/list` returns the complete tool catalog in a single response (no pagination). Pagination was tried briefly (page size 50, cursor-based) but removed because many MCP clients — including the Claude.ai connector — do NOT iterate `nextCursor` automatically, which silently truncated the catalog at the first 50 tools. The full-catalog response is backstopped by the universal response-size guard inside `handleMcpRequest` (124,000-byte threshold) that emits a loud `-32603 "Response too large"` envelope if the catalog ever exceeds the hub's 128KB JSON-RPC limit — better to fail loud than silently lose tools. Stale clients that pass a `cursor` param get the full catalog and find no `nextCursor`, so any iteration loop terminates after one call. Opt-in cursor pagination on `tools/call` (`hub_list_devices`, `hub_list_apps`, `hub_list_rules`, etc.) is unaffected — see the next section.

### `tools/call` Response-Size Guard (v1.3.x+, fail-soft)

Every `tools/call` response is measured before send. If the wire-encoded response exceeds the universal 120,000-byte cap (~11 KB headroom under the hub's 131072-byte (128 KiB) JSON-RPC limit), the inner content is replaced with a structured fail-soft envelope:

```json
{
  "response_too_large": true,
  "truncated": true,
  "estimatedBytes": 145320,
  "sizeLimitBytes": 120000,
  "tool": "hub_list_apps",
  "suggestion": "Set includeHidden=false (the default), narrow via filter ..., or pass cursor to page through the apps list."
}
```

The outer JSON-RPC envelope still reports success (this is not a tool error — the tool ran, the result just didn't fit). Treat `response_too_large=true` as a hint to either (a) narrow your query — the per-tool `suggestion` field names the specific knob — or (b) opt into pagination on tools that support it. The `tool` field reflects the actual sub-tool on gateway-routed calls so you can re-issue a narrower call directly.

The following read-only tools support pagination. List tools return the full list when cursor is omitted (subject to the response-size guard); pass `cursor: ""` to start a page, then follow `nextCursor`. Two reads also paginate oversized responses automatically: `hub_get_device` fragments expanded configuration/details, and `hub_get_tool_guide` pages the full guide. Cursors are opaque; malformed or out-of-range values reject as `-32602`.

List pagination remains opt-in. Ordinary device summaries and small expanded reads keep their structured response; see Device inspection below for fragment assembly and snapshot expiry.

| Tool | Page size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `hub_list_devices` | 50 (when `limit` unset) | Cursor is an alias for the existing `offset`+`limit` shape; `nextCursor` is emitted alongside `nextOffset`. |
| `hub_get_device` | 18,000 characters | Oversized configuration/details only: concatenate JSON fragments from one snapshot using unchanged arguments within five minutes. Empty cursor starts a new read. |
| `hub_list_apps` | 50 | `scope='types'` (default): catalog of installable apps. `scope='instances'`: installed app instances; cursor respects `filter` — pages the filtered set. |
| `hub_list_drivers` | 50 | Catalog of installable drivers. |
| `hub_list_libraries` | 50 | Installed Groovy libraries (id, name, namespace, version); source omitted (read via `hub_get_source`). |
| `hub_list_bundles` | 50 | Installed code bundles (Bundle-Manager containers); id, name, namespace, private, and a contains summary. |
| `hub_list_hpm_packages` | 25 | Smaller page because each HPM entry carries the full app/driver/file inventory. |
| `hub_list_rules` | 50 | RM 4.x + 5.x deduplicated rules. |
| `hub_get_custom_rule` | 50 | Legacy MCP rule engine; list mode (omit `ruleId`). |
| `hub_list_variables` | 100 | Pages `hubVariables`; `ruleVariables` stays in full alongside the page. |
| `hub_list_captured_states` | 50 | Capacity warnings still emitted regardless of pagination. |
| `hub_list_backups` | 50 | Sorted newest-first; page boundaries are stable as long as the manifest doesn't change. |
| `hub_list_files` | 100 | File Manager listing. |
| `hub_list_devices` | 50 | `filter='virtual'` mode: MCP-managed virtual devices. |
| `hub_list_rooms` | 100 | Rooms with device counts. |
| `hub_get_device_health` | 100 | Pages `staleDevices`; `unknownDevices` (and `healthyDevices` when `includeHealthy=true`) stay in full. |
| `hub_list_device_dependents` | 100 | Pages `appsUsing`. |
| `hub_get_logs` | 100 | Filters + `limit` apply first; cursor pages within the filtered result. |
| `hub_get_memory_history` | 100 | `limit=0` + cursor pages the full hub ring buffer (the only way to retrieve every entry without losing data). |
| `hub_get_tool_guide` | 90,000 chars | Pages without opting in: the no-section full-guide call is ~188 KB against the 120 KB cap, so it returns a first page plus `nextCursor` rather than a size-guard envelope. Every named section and sub-section still fits one response, so they carry no `nextCursor` and reject a `cursor` outright rather than silently serving a headless slice. Pages break on line boundaries; `offset`/`totalChars` ride along on a split response, and `nextCursor` is absent (not null) on the last page. |
| `hub_get_jobs` | 100 | Pages `scheduledJobs`; `runningJobs` and `hubActions` stay in full. Served from a 30 s cached `/logs/json` snapshot shared with `hub_get_performance_stats`, so a traversal is best-effort past that TTL. When the transport carries a time budget (`relayBudgetMs` over the cloud relay, `lanBudgetMs` on LAN) the fetch runs in the background and the call continues via `requestState`; legacy clients repeat the identical call on `status: "in_progress"`. |

Tools without cursor support (`hub_get_app_config`, `hub_export_native_app`, `hub_get_source`) rely on their existing controls (`includeSettings=false`, `saveAs=<file>`, `hub_list_files`/`hub_read_file` round-trip) plus the universal size guard as the backstop.

## Device Authorization (CRITICAL)

**Exact match rule:**
- If user specifies a device name that EXACTLY matches a device label (case-insensitive OK), use it directly
- Example: User says "turn on Kitchen Light" and device "Kitchen Light" exists → use it

**Non-exact match rule:**
- If no exact match exists, search for similar devices
- Present options to user and **wait for explicit confirmation** before using any device
- Example: User says "use test switch" but only "Virtual Test Switch" exists → ask "Did you mean 'Virtual Test Switch'?"

**Uncertain command outcome:** `outcomeUnknown: true` means the native command request failed without proving whether the device acted. Read the device state or event history before deciding whether to retry; blindly repeating a non-idempotent command can apply it twice.

**Health probes over the cloud relay:** `hub_get_device_health` uses the existing read-snapshot continuation path for modern MCP clients with a transport budget. Traceroute, speedtest and the associated health inventory run once; continuations and terminal replay read that snapshot. The native probe timeouts remain unchanged. A probe that exceeds the bounded continuation window returns `slow_read_timeout`; it may still be running, so do not automatically launch another probe. Long speedtests or combined probes can exceed this window.

**Partial virtual results:** `success: true, partialSuccess: true` means a created device or some inventory entries are usable, but native metadata or namespace verification is incomplete. Inspect the warnings and unreadable device IDs. A created ID/DNI already exists: repair or re-read it rather than creating another device. An entirely unreadable inventory returns `success: false, isError: true`; a partial inventory must not be treated as complete.

**Tool failure rule:**
- If a tool fails (e.g., `hub_manage_virtual_device` returns an error), report the failure to the user
- Do NOT silently fall back to using existing devices as a workaround
- Example: If creating a virtual device fails, don't just grab an existing device to use instead

**Why this matters:**
- Wrong device could control critical systems (HVAC, locks, security)
- User trust depends on AI only controlling what they explicitly authorized

**Device allowlist bypass (`bypassDeviceAllowlist`, default OFF):**

Native device operations require the MCP app's Hub Security credentials when Hub Security is enabled; without them, native reads and writes cannot authenticate.

- The device tools normally resolve a `deviceId` only against the operator-selected device list (`selectedDevices`) plus MCP-managed virtual devices; an id outside that set returns `Device not found`.
- Device reads, commands, configuration writes, inventory, health checks, dependent lookups, swaps and replacements use native hub endpoints. With bypass OFF, access is limited to selected devices plus MCP-owned children. With bypass ON, these operations can reach any existing device; the Read/Write masters, confirmations and operation-specific eligibility checks still apply. MCP-owned virtual inventory remains ownership-scoped. Hub logs, including device-filtered logs, remain readable regardless of device selection or bypass; the Read master still applies. Explicit scope=all inventory and existing administrative force-delete operations retain their documented broader scope.
- Native attribute discovery contains reported current states, including their available types and values; unset or cleared attributes can be absent. An explicit missing-attribute read returns null with neverReported, and polling may time out instead of rejecting an unknown name. A command with waitFor can therefore execute before a mistyped attribute times out. Supported-command and argument validation still run before command execution. Attribute discovery is reported-state only on EVERY path (selected devices included): `attributes` in list/detail reads and `declaredAttributes` in details mode carry current states, and an attribute the driver declares but has never set is absent, not unsupported (`attributeCoverage.declarationsComplete: false` says so in-band). Attribute values keep the driver-declared type: an attribute whose native record carries `dataType: NUMBER` is a JSON number, every other value is a string, and the type is stable per attribute; the `hubitat://context` and `hubitat://context-summary` resources are served from one bulk hub read and carry string values without unit suffixes. Whole-population reads -- the two context resources and every `hub_list_devices` filter -- come from that single bulk read, never one native read per device; only a device the bulk read does not cover costs a per-device read (capped at 20 for the resources, with the rest reported as state unavailable). One unreadable device no longer fails `hub_list_devices`: it is listed with `metadataUnavailable: true`, excluded from any active filter, named in `metadataUnavailableIds`, and the response carries `partial: true`; a bypass inventory whose id set could not be vouched for is returned with `idsComplete: false` instead of an error. Swap and replace both verify a bypass-only id against native metadata before any native request. The legacy custom-rule engine keeps its own selection-only device references; bypass does not extend to it.
- This is a deliberate operator choice that **removes the device-selection security boundary**. The exact-match / confirm-before-use discipline above matters even more when it is on.

## Best-Practice Reference

Surfaced via `hub_get_tool_guide(section='best_practice_reference')`. This section backs the two best-practice aids (issue #299):

- **Require Best-Practice Guide Acknowledgment** (`enableMandatoryBPS`) — **ON by default**. While on, every write tool is blocked until the AI reads this guide section and passes the acknowledgment key it publishes as the `bestPracticeKey` argument. The **Acknowledgment key** value lives only in the in-app guide section (served by `hub_get_tool_guide`), never in this doc, so reading the guide is the only way to obtain it. `hub_get_tool_guide` and `hub_update_mcp_settings` are exempt from the gate, so the AI can always read the key or toggle the gate off — it can never lock itself out.
- **Reactive best-practice hints** — **always on, no toggle**. When a write tool errors, the error gains a one-line pointer to **that tool's own** guide section (not a generic page), so the AI can recover from the failing tool's reference.

The best practices it teaches:

- Prefer **native Rule Machine** (`hub_manage_native_rules_and_apps` / `hub_set_rule`) over the legacy `custom_*` rule engine for new automation work.
- Resolve devices by exact `deviceId` (compare as strings) with `hub_list_devices` before acting.
- Destructive writes need `confirm=true` plus a backup within 24h (`hub_create_backup`).

This is the consolidation target: best-practice content can move here from individual write-tool descriptions over time, kept lean on the wire while the gate guarantees the AI has read it.

## Destructive Write Tools - Pre-Flight Checklist

All destructive write tools (the `confirm`+backup tier) require these steps:

1. **Backup check**: Ensure a hub backup exists within the last 24 hours — `hub_create_backup`, or any backup already in `hub_list_backups` (scope=hub_local); the gate consults the hub's own backup list when this app's record is stale, so scheduled backups count
2. **Inform user**: Tell them what you're about to do
3. **Get confirmation**: Wait for explicit "yes", "confirm", or "proceed"
4. **Set confirm=true**: Pass the confirm parameter

### Tool-Specific Requirements

**hub_reboot** (via `hub_manage_destructive_ops`)
- Effects: 1-3 min downtime, all automations stop, scheduled jobs lost, radios restart
- Only use when user explicitly requests a reboot

**hub_shutdown** (via `hub_manage_destructive_ops`)
- Effects: Powers OFF completely, requires physical restart (unplug/replug)
- This is NOT a reboot - hub stays off until manually restarted
- Only use when user explicitly requests shutdown

**hub_delete_device** (via `hub_manage_destructive_ops`)
- MOST DESTRUCTIVE tool - NO UNDO
- Intended for: ghost/orphaned devices, stale DB records, stuck virtual devices
- Additional steps: Use `hub_get_device` to verify correct device, warn if recent activity
- For Z-Wave/Zigbee: Warn user to do proper exclusion first to avoid ghost nodes
- All device details logged to MCP debug logs for audit

**hub_call_destructive_ops** (via `hub_manage_destructive_ops`)
- Destructive hub operations selected by `target` + `action` — NO UNDO / can disconnect:
  - `target=zwave|zigbee|matter`: `reset` wipes that radio's network/fabric (orphans all its paired devices); firmware flashes (`device_firmware_start`/`device_firmware_abort`, `zwave_chip_firmware`, `zigbee_firmware`) can brick hardware if interrupted
  - `target=network`: `disconnect_wifi` / `disconnect_ethernet` drop that link — the hub may become unreachable over it
  - `target=cloud`: `disable` severs the cloud controller (Alexa/Google, cloud dashboards, cloud firmware updates, Hub Protect/subscriptions all stop); `enable` restores it
- Three-layer safety gate: Write master + hub backup within 24h + explicit `confirm=true`
- Warn the user about the exact impact before proceeding; only use when the user explicitly requests the operation
- Do NOT power-cycle the hub or device during a firmware flash

**hub_call_zwave** (via `hub_manage_radio`)
- Z-Wave radio operations selected by `action` — network repair is one action
- Repair effects: 5-30 min duration, Z-Wave devices may be unresponsive; best run during off-peak hours
- Only use when user explicitly requests the operation

**hub_delete_room** (via `hub_manage_rooms`)
- Devices become unassigned (not deleted)
- List affected devices to user before proceeding
- Dashboard layouts and automations referencing room may be affected

**hub_create_app** (via `hub_manage_code`)
- Accepts `source` (inline Groovy) OR `sourceFile` (filename in File Manager). Provide exactly one.
- Token-economy tip: upload large source via local CLI first, then pass the filename as `sourceFile`. Avoids re-sending multi-KB source strings on each install attempt.
- Performs post-install verification: after the hub creates the item, fetches it back to confirm the Groovy compiled cleanly. Returns `success: false` with `appId` populated when the hub reports a compile error or the verify response is empty/unparseable, so the error can be inspected via `hub_get_source` (type=app, id). If the hub returns no item ID at all (no `Location` header), `appId` is `null`. Transient verify-fetch failures keep `success: true` but set `verified: false` plus `verifyError`.
- Requires the Write master + confirm + backup <24h.

**hub_create_driver** (via `hub_manage_code`)
- Single-driver mode: supply `source` (inline Groovy) OR `sourceFile` (filename in File Manager). Provide exactly one.
- Bulk mode: supply an `installs` array of objects, each with `source` or `sourceFile`. Cannot combine with single-driver fields.
  - Continue-on-error: errors on individual items do not abort remaining installs. Returns a per-item status array with each item's `driverId`.
  - Top-level `success: true` only if ALL items succeeded.
  - Practical limit: ~10-20 drivers per call (each install is a sequential on-hub compilation, ~1-5 seconds each).
  - Token-economy pattern: upload all driver source files via local CLI, then call bulk `hub_create_driver` once with all `{sourceFile}` entries.
- Performs post-install verification: after the hub creates each item, fetches it back to confirm the Groovy compiled cleanly. Returns `success: false` with `driverId` populated when the hub reports a compile error or the verify response is empty/unparseable, so the error can be inspected via `hub_get_source` (type=driver, id). If the hub returns no item ID at all (no `Location` header), `driverId` is `null`. Transient verify-fetch failures keep `success: true` but set `verified: false` plus `verifyError`.
- Requires the Write master + confirm + backup <24h.

**hub_update_app** (via `hub_manage_code`)
- Supply `appId` + one of `source` / `sourceFile` / `resave` (and/or `oauth`, below).
- **OAuth fold (apps only):** pass `oauth = {enabled (bool, default true), client_id?, client_secret?, refresh_secret? (bool)}` to enable/configure OAuth on the app code definition — the programmatic equivalent of the UI's "Enable OAuth in App". Use it to ship apps with OAuth already on instead of the manual UI step. The result comes back under `result.oauth = {success, enabled, clientId, clientSecret}` (the hub generates `clientId`/`clientSecret` on first enable; omit them to preserve the app's current values, which mirrors the UI's pre-fill — but if the hub can't read the current creds to preserve them, the OAuth leg fails (`success:false`) instead of submitting empty and blanking a live client, so pass `client_id`+`client_secret` to override). Works alone (no source mode required) or alongside a source update (`partial: true` if the source saved but the OAuth leg failed). The app's source must declare OAuth (an `oauth` block in `definition` + `mappings`) for the enable to succeed. **Self-protection:** refuses to alter the MCP server's own app OAuth unless Developer Mode is on — its client id/secret back the live `/mcp` access token, so changing them would break the connection.
- Self-update guard: applies when `appId` matches this MCP server's own app — its installed instance id OR its Apps Code class id (resolved via `_resolveSelfAppClassId`, since a code update targets the class id, which differs from the instance id). Refuses to overwrite that source unless **Enable Developer Mode Tools** is on in the MCP Rule Server app settings (a bad self-update bricks the MCP loop; recovery requires the Hubitat UI or SSH). Every self-update attempt — blocked OR allowed — is audit-logged at WARN under the `hub-admin` component. If the app context is unavailable at call time (rare lifecycle window) the guard fails closed with an ERROR audit log; retry the call.
- Optional `expectedVersion` (integer): optimistic-lock guard. When supplied and the hub's version differs, the update returns `success: false` + `conflict: true` with both `expectedVersion` and `currentVersion` echoed. Use when an agent's read-modify-write spans turns or runs alongside other agents/tools that could mutate the same app. Backup still happens on conflict (intentional: `backupItemSource` has a 1h cache so the parallel-agent retry costs nothing, and the first caller losing the race still has a recovery point). Stringified integers are coerced; explicit `null` is rejected (omit the field entirely to skip the lock).
- Requires the Write master + confirm + backup <24h.

**hub_update_driver** (via `hub_manage_code`)
- Single-driver mode (unchanged): supply `driverId` + one of `source` / `sourceFile` / `resave`. Optional `expectedVersion` (integer): same optimistic-lock semantics as `hub_update_app` — conflict envelope carries `driverId` instead of `appId`.
- Bulk mode: supply an `updates` array of objects, each with `driverId` and one of `sourceFile` / `source` / `resave`, plus optional per-item `expectedVersion`. Cannot combine with single-driver fields (including a top-level `expectedVersion` — put it on each entry instead).
  - Continue-on-error: errors on individual items do not abort remaining updates. Returns a per-item status array. Per-item conflicts (failed lock) carry `conflict: true` + `expectedVersion` + `currentVersion`; per-item thrown errors carry `error` + `errorClass`. Other items in the batch still apply.
  - Top-level `success: true` only if ALL items succeeded.
  - Practical limit: ~20 drivers per call (each update is a sequential on-hub compilation, ~1-5 seconds each).
  - Token-economy pattern: upload all updated driver files via local CLI (curl -F / PowerShell Invoke-RestMethod), then call bulk `hub_update_driver` once with all `{driverId, sourceFile}` pairs.

**hub_delete_item** (type: app|driver|library, via `hub_manage_code`)
- Remove app instances via Hubitat UI first (for apps)
- Change devices to different driver first (for drivers)
- Ensure no drivers/apps reference the library via #include before deleting (for libraries)
- Source code auto-backed up before deletion

## Virtual Device Types

`hub_manage_virtual_device` (action: "create") supports two mutually exclusive driver selection methods:

**Option A: deviceType** -- built-in Hubitat virtual drivers (pass one of the values below):

| Type | Description | Common Use Case |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Virtual Switch | on/off toggle | Boolean flags, triggers |
| Virtual Button | pushable button | Triggering automations |
| Virtual Contact Sensor | open/closed | Simulate door/window state |
| Virtual Motion Sensor | active/inactive | Simulate motion detection |
| Virtual Presence | present/not present | Presence simulation |
| Virtual Lock | lock/unlock | Lock state simulation |
| Virtual Temperature Sensor | numeric temp | Temperature reporting |
| Virtual Humidity Sensor | numeric humidity | Humidity reporting |
| Virtual Dimmer | switch + level 0-100 | Dimmable light simulation |
| Virtual RGBW Light | color-controllable | Color light simulation |
| Virtual Shade | open/close + position | Window shade control |
| Virtual Garage Door Opener | open/close | Garage door state |
| Virtual Water Sensor | wet/dry | Water leak simulation |
| Virtual Omni Sensor | multi-purpose | Combined sensor types |
| Virtual Fan Controller | fan speed control | Fan simulation |

**Option B: customDriver** -- user-installed drivers (pass `{namespace, name}`); mutually exclusive with `deviceType`:
```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "deviceLabel": "Kitchen Humidifier Test",
  "customDriver": { "namespace": "level99-vesync", "name": "Levoit Classic 200S Humidifier" },
  "confirm": true
}
```
Use `hub_read_apps_code(tool="hub_list_drivers")` to see installed drivers and their namespace + name values. The namespace and name must match exactly as registered. If the driver is not found (or any other hub error), the tool surfaces an `IllegalArgumentException` (-32602) pointing to `hub_list_drivers`. If a built-in `deviceType` is not found on the hub, the tool surfaces an isError platform error (firmware gap, not a caller error).

**Create response shape** (both modes): `{ success, message, tips, device: { id, name, label, deviceNetworkId, driverNamespace, driverType, typeName, capabilities, commands, attributes } }`. `typeName` is a deprecated alias for `driverType` -- prefer `driverType` in new code.

**Delete response shape** (`action=delete`): `{ success, deviceId, deviceNetworkId, deviceLabel, message }`.

**List response shape** (`hub_list_devices` with `filter='virtual'`): `{ devices: [...], count, message }`. Per-device: `{ id, name, label, deviceNetworkId, driverNamespace, driverType, typeName, capabilities, commands, currentStates }`. `currentStates` is a map of attribute-name to current-value. Note: create returns device state as `attributes` (list) while list returns it as `currentStates` (map) -- different shapes for the same concept because create returns the freshly-read attribute list and list returns a compact state map. `typeName` is a deprecated alias for `driverType` -- prefer `driverType` in new code. `driverNamespace` is authoritative for devices created by this tool (the namespace is persisted at create time); when the persisted namespace is absent, it uses the native device type namespace and reports a warning if native driver identity is unavailable.

MCP-managed virtual devices:
- Auto-accessible to all MCP device tools without manual selection
- Appear in Hubitat UI for Maker API, Dashboard, Rule Machine sharing
- Use `hub_manage_virtual_device` (action: "delete") to remove (not `hub_delete_device`)

## Device inspection

`hub_get_device(deviceId=...)` keeps its concise summary of capabilities,
reported attributes (current states -- a declared-but-never-set attribute is
absent, not unsupported) and commands. Use `mode="configuration"` before updating a device:
it returns `editableFields`, all available preference declarations and current
values, actual driver identity, and source/read-status information. A saved
`false`, zero, empty string or null is distinct from an unset value. Defaults
describe the driver declaration; they do not prove a setting was saved.

Use `mode="details"` for comprehensive inspection. Optional `sections` select
`configuration`, `identity`, `attributes`, `commands`, `data`, `state`,
`relationships`, `jobs`, `integrations`, or `metadata`. Event/log histories use
the linked read tools instead of inflating every device response. Missing or
unrecognized native data is reported as partial/unavailable, never as proof
that the device has no settings. Sensitive values are redacted.

For smaller expanded reads, pass `fields=[]` to discover `availableFields`, then
select exact names, for example `fields=["txtEnable"]` in configuration mode or
`sections=["state"], fields=["lastRefresh"]` in details mode. Configuration
selection applies to preference names, editable property names and device-info
keys. Details selection applies to section keys; attributes also accepts an
individual attribute name. Commands and jobs use the row indices returned by
`availableFields`, so duplicate or unnamed rows remain selectable. Omitting
`fields` retains the full selected sections.

If even one selected value exceeds the response budget, the tool returns
`contentFormat="json-fragment"`, a `content` string and `nextCursor`. Repeat the
same read with that cursor, concatenate the fragments in order, then parse the
joined JSON. This also handles large field-name indexes. The cursor is bound to
the original redacted snapshot, so later telemetry changes do not alter its
pages. Continue within five minutes with the same device, mode, sections and
fields. Expiry, eviction or a server reload requires restarting without cursor.
At most eight snapshots and 2,097,152 UTF-16 code units of serialized JSON are retained in memory; select
fewer fields if the budget is exceeded. Authorization is checked on every page.
Ordinary reads keep their structured response.

The actual driver name is separate from the device's mutable name. `driverSource`
provides a verified source call when a user driver can be resolved, or a driver
catalog lookup and the reason source is unavailable. Built-in source is not
promised. Source code can supply further declarations, but cannot establish
the device's current saved preferences.

All modes are reachable through `hub_read_devices` with the Write master off;
device authorization still applies. For example:

```json
{"tool":"hub_get_device","args":{"deviceId":"42","mode":"configuration"}}
```

## hub_update_device Properties

Every update requires the Write master and applicable tool permissions. When
mandatory best-practice acknowledgment is enabled, read the guide first and put
`bestPracticeKey` inside the gateway's `args` alongside the patch.

| Properties | Read/write behavior |
|------------|---------------------|
| `label`, `name`, `deviceNetworkId` | Device identity; network-ID changes require confirmation and backup. |
| `dataValues`, `preferences` | Data-section values and declared driver preferences; inspect configuration first. |
| `room`, `enabled`, `showOnHome`, `defaultCurrentState`, `tags` | Room, device availability, Home visibility, status attribute and replacement tag set. |
| `deviceTypeId`, `zigbeeId` | Driver and radio identity; applicable devices only, confirmation and backup required. |
| `notes`, `defaultIcon` | Device note and icon override; empty string clears. |
| `maxEvents`, `maxStates`, `spammyThreshold` | Native history limits (1–2000) and event-alert threshold (100–2000). |
| `dashboardIds`, `meshEnabled`, `meshFullSync` | Applicable dashboard/mesh assignments; confirmation and backup required. |
| `retryEnabled` | Command retry, only where the native device exposes it. |
| `homeKitEnabled`, `amazonAlexaEnabled`, `googleHomeEnabled` | Supported and installed assistant assignments; confirmation and backup required. |

Configuration mode identifies each field's applicability and readback source.
Omitted properties are
preserved. The complete patch is validated before writes begin; runtime failures
report per-property successes and errors, so inspect the result before retrying.

**Preferences format:**
```json
{
  "pollInterval": {"type": "number", "value": 30},
  "debugLogging": {"type": "bool", "value": true}
}
```

Use the preference's declared type, allowed values and range from configuration
mode. Unknown names are refused. An unreadable schema/readback is reported
separately from an unknown name or a value that did not persist. Omit a preference
to preserve it. To clear an optional preference, pass an explicit entry such as
`"debugLogging": {"clear": true}`. Null, empty strings, whitespace and empty arrays
are rejected; do not combine `clear` with `value`. Required preferences cannot be cleared.
Both `bool` and `boolean` declarations are supported. A driver default displayed
afterward remains a default, not a saved value. Preference saves preserve Home visibility, status
display and command-retry settings unless the patch explicitly changes them.

If an unset enum reports `multiple: null`, check `driverSource` or metadata captured
before clearing, then supply `multiple: true` or `multiple: false` alongside `value`
when restoring it. For example, `{"colors": {"value": ["red"], "multiple": true}}`
restores a declared multi-select enum; do not guess its selection cardinality.

**Room assignment:** Existing names use case-insensitive exact matching; an empty string removes the assignment.

## Rule Structure Reference

### Triggers
- `device_event` - Device attribute changes (supports duration for debounce, multi-device via deviceIds array)
- `button_event` - Button pushed/held/doubleTapped
- `time` - Specific time (HH:mm) or sunrise/sunset with offset
- `periodic` - Interval-based

## App/Driver/Library Code Management

### Reading Source Code
- `hub_get_source` (type=app|driver|library, id; via `hub_read_apps_code`) supports chunked reading for large files
- Large files auto-saved to File Manager as `mcp-source-app-{id}.groovy`, `mcp-source-driver-{id}.groovy`, or `mcp-source-library-{id}.groovy`
- Use this saved file with `sourceFile` parameter in update tools

### Updating Code
Three modes available:
1. **source** - Provide full source directly (for files <64KB)
2. **sourceFile** - Read from File Manager file (for large files, avoids cloud limits)
3. **resave** - Re-save current source without changes (recompile, trigger backup)

Auto-backs up before modifying. Rapid edits within 1 hour preserve the original.

### Libraries
Hubitat Groovy libraries are shared code modules included by drivers and apps via `#include namespace.LibraryName`. The library management tools mirror the app/driver pattern:
- `hub_create_library` - Install a new library from Groovy source (inline or via File Manager file)
- `hub_update_library` - Update existing library source (source/sourceFile/resave modes)
- `hub_delete_item` (type=library) - Delete a library (auto-backs up source first)
- `hub_get_source` (type=library, id) - Read library source with chunked reading support

Libraries must include a valid `library()` definition block. Before deleting a library, ensure no installed drivers or apps reference it via `#include` -- deleting a library in use causes compilation errors in the referencing code.

PREFER curl-upload + sourceFile (bypasses agent context, no transcript size limits). Use inline `source` only for stub-size snippets:
```bash
# Without Hub Security:
curl -F "uploadFile=@mylib.groovy" -F "folder=/" http://<HUB_IP>/hub/fileManager/upload

# With Hub Security enabled (cookie-based):
curl -c cookies.txt -d "username=USER&password=PASS" http://<HUB_IP>/login
curl -b cookies.txt -F "uploadFile=@mylib.groovy" -F "folder=/" http://<HUB_IP>/hub/fileManager/upload
```
Then call `hub_create_library` or `hub_update_library` with `sourceFile: 'mylib.groovy'`.

Note: `hub_get_source` (type=library; read-only, Read master) lives in `hub_read_apps_code` and serves apps, drivers, and libraries via its `type` discriminator. The write operations (`hub_create_library`, `hub_update_library`, `hub_delete_item` with type=library) live in `hub_manage_code` (Write master).

#### Bundles (`hub_install_bundle`)
A bundle is a `.zip` that Hubitat Package Manager (HPM) fetches and unpacks into the hub's Libraries/Apps/Drivers Code in one shot — it is how an installed package actually delivers its library files to the hub. `hub_install_bundle` performs that exact server-side install (`importUrl` -> the hub's `/bundle2/uploadZipFromUrl`, falling back to `/bundle/uploadZipFromUrl` on firmware older than 2.3.8.108), so a package's bundle can be installed and verified the HPM way without driving the HPM UI. Requires `confirm: true` and a recent backup. `installer: true` marks the bundle as the installer's primary copy (matches HPM's "private" flag). Unlike `hub_create_library` (single library from inline/File-Manager source), this installs whatever the zip contains, in HPM's install order.

### After Installation
- Apps: Add via Apps > Add User App in Hubitat web UI
- Drivers: Can be assigned to devices immediately
- Libraries: Available immediately for `#include` in driver/app source

---

## Backup System

### Hub Backups
- `hub_create_backup` creates full hub database backup
- Required within 24 hours before any destructive write operation (the `confirm`+backup tier)
- Only destructive write tool that doesn't require a prior backup
- Managed via the `hub_manage_backup` gateway: `hub_list_backups` (`scope=hub_local`/`hub_cloud`/`hub` for whole-hub DB backups; default `scope=source` lists code backups), `hub_get_backup`, `hub_restore_backup`, and `hub_delete_backup` (delete a whole-hub DB backup, local or cloud)

### Source Code Backups (Automatic)
- Created automatically when using hub_update_app, hub_update_driver, hub_update_library, hub_delete_item (type=app|driver|library)
- Stored in File Manager as `.groovy` files
- Persist even if MCP uninstalled
- Max 20 kept, oldest pruned
- Rapid edits preserve original (1-hour protection)
- App/driver restores return `undoAvailable=true` and a `preRestoreBackup` handle only when the undo file is verified. A failed required pre-restore capture aborts before saving the source. Only a retry whose live source already matches the target backup may succeed without verified undo, with `undoAvailable=false` and a warning; do not rely on an older undo record for that restore.

### Custom-engine Rule Backups (Automatic)
- `hub_delete_custom_rule` auto-backs up to File Manager as `mcp_rule_backup_<name>_<timestamp>.json`
- Restore via: `hub_read_file` → `hub_import_custom_rule`
- Skip backup for test rules: set `testRule: true` when creating/updating

### Native RM Rule Backups (Automatic)
- Existing-rule edits ensure a File Manager baseline exists as `mcp-rm-backup-<ruleId>-<timestamp>.json` (a `-<uuid>` suffix is added if two snapshots land in the same millisecond); by default the newest same-rule baseline is reused for one hour. Restoring it returns the rule to the start of that edit chain and undoes every later edit. Enable **Back up before every native app edit** under Advanced settings for a fresh snapshot on every edit. Deletes and destructive Required Expression replacement always snapshot immediately before the operation.
- Snapshots register in the unified `atomicState.itemBackupManifest` with type=`rm-rule`
- A failed configuration read permits recreation only when the app inventory confirms the original rule is absent. Otherwise restore stops before creating a replacement or changing settings.
- Use `hub_list_backups` (in `hub_read_apps_code` / `hub_manage_backup`) to enumerate, `hub_restore_backup` (in `hub_manage_backup`) with the backupKey to roll back
- If the rule still exists, settings are replayed in place; if deleted, a fresh empty rule is recreated and the saved settings replayed onto it

### Hubitat Built-in Rule Redirect
When `hub_get_custom_rule`, `hub_export_custom_rule`, `hub_update_custom_rule`, `hub_delete_custom_rule`, `hub_test_custom_rule`, or `hub_clone_custom_rule` fails
with "Rule not found", the error message may include a redirect hint if the ID belongs to a
Hubitat built-in rule-like app (Rule Machine, Room Lighting, Basic Rules, Visual Rules Builder).

Example redirect message:
> "Rule 832 is a Hubitat built-in Rule-5.1 app. Use `hub_read_apps_code -> hub_get_app_config(appId=832)` to read its configuration."

- Read verbs (`hub_get_custom_rule`, `hub_export_custom_rule`, `hub_clone_custom_rule`): points to `hub_get_app_config` and notes these tools only handle MCP's own rule engine.
- Write verbs (`hub_update_custom_rule`): points to `hub_get_app_config` for inspection and `hub_manage_rule_machine -> hub_set_rule` for programmatic modification (requires the Write master).
- Delete verb (`hub_delete_custom_rule`): points to `hub_manage_native_rules_and_apps -> hub_delete_native_app` for programmatic deletion.
- Test verb (`hub_test_custom_rule`): points to `hub_read_apps_code -> hub_get_app_config` for inspection. For Rule Machine rules specifically, the hint also includes a pointer to `hub_manage_native_rules_and_apps -> hub_call_rule` to trigger them; non-RM rule-likes (Room Lighting, Basic Rules, Visual Rule Builder) receive only the `hub_get_app_config` pointer because `hub_call_rule` routes through `RMUtils.sendAction` and is RM-only.
- The redirect check is best-effort: if the hub appsList call fails, a plain "Rule not found" message is returned with no secondary error.
- `hub_get_custom_rule` in list mode (ruleId omitted) and `hub_create_custom_rule` are not affected (they do not take a rule id as input).

## File Manager

Files stored locally on hub at `http://<HUB_IP>/local/<filename>`

**File name rules:**
- Must match `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$`
- No spaces, no leading period
- Valid: `my-config.json`, `backup_2024.txt`
- Invalid: `.hidden`, `my file.txt`, `../escape`

**Chunked reading:**
- Use `offset` and `length` parameters for files >60KB
- Each chunk must be <60KB due to response size limits

---

## Performance Tips

**hub_call_device_command with `commands` — the biggest single win on a multi-device intent:**
- The per-call ROUND TRIP dominates, not the hub actuating the device. Measured on a live hub over LAN: one command ~1.0s end to end, six separate commands ~4.4s (~0.73s each)
- So collapse them: the same six Z-Wave switches as one `commands` batch measured **~1.5s**, and a batch of 1, 2 or 4 devices is **flat at ~0.95s** — the signature of the round trip being the entire cost. Reach for it whenever an intent touches more than one device ("turn off the kitchen lights", "close all the shades"). `commands` is mutually exclusive with `deviceId`/`command` and cannot be combined with `waitFor`
- A device behind a BRIDGE is the exception: six Bond shades batched measured ~2.75s (vs ~5.0s separately), because that hop costs real time per device which batching cannot remove
- Firing the separate calls in parallel does NOT help — the hub serialises them anyway (same reason as "Make tool calls sequentially, not in parallel" below)
- It does not make the devices move simultaneously; the hub still actuates one at a time. What disappears is the overhead
- Entries are independent, so mixed devices and mixed commands go in one batch. Max 20. An entry's `deviceId` may be an integer (the shape `hub_list_devices` `format='ids'` returns) as well as a string, and a `parameters` value that arrives as a string is repaired by the same normalizer the single-device form uses. A bad entry is reported in its own `results[]` slot and the rest still fire; malformed input (missing `deviceId`, a `parameters` value that is neither an array nor a string, >20 entries) is rejected BEFORE anything is sent, so a bad request never actuates part of a batch
- The aggregate always carries `success`, `count` (entries attempted), `sentCount`, `failedCount` (`0` on a clean batch) and `results`. When at least one entry failed it also carries `failedDeviceIds`, `error` and `note`, plus `partial: true` when only SOME failed; `isError: true` is reserved for the batch where every entry failed
- Per-entry results carry NO `state` snapshot — the batch fires, it does not read back. To confirm the result, follow with `hub_get_device_attribute` using `deviceIds` (multi-device convergence) — one batch to fire, one poll to confirm, two round trips for the whole group
- A large batch that nears the relay's ~6s time budget part way through stops dispatching rather than losing the response: it returns `stoppedEarly: true` plus `remainingCommands`, the entries it did not send, ready to pass straight back as the `commands` of a second call. Whatever it did attempt is in `results[]` as usual
- For a set commanded repeatedly, a group or scene beats both: one device to command and the hub fans out. `commands` is for the ad-hoc set that was never defined in advance

**hub_list_devices:**
- Use `detailed=false` for initial discovery
- **Inventory counts:** `count` is the number returned on this page; `total` is the matching count before pagination; `unfilteredTotal`, when present, is the count in the requested device scope before filters or pagination (not necessarily the whole hub).
- Summary response always includes: id, name (driver type), label, room, `disabled`, `deviceNetworkId`, `lastActivity`, `parentDeviceId` + `currentStates` dict. Detailed mode replaces `currentStates` with `capabilities`, `attributes`, `commands`. To count children of a parent device, group on `parentDeviceId` client-side
- **Server-side filters** (all applied before pagination, composable with each other):
  - `filter` — `'enabled'` / `'disabled'` / `'stale:<hours>'` (boolean and time-relative queries)
  - `labelFilter` — case-insensitive substring match on device label (e.g. `'kitchen'` returns all devices whose label contains "kitchen")
  - `capabilityFilter` — case-insensitive exact match on capability name (e.g. `'Switch'`, `'TemperatureMeasurement'`)
  - `roomFilter` — case-insensitive EXACT match on the device's assigned room name; a zero-match total reports `roomFilterMatchedKnownRoom` (typo-vs-absence, over MCP-visible devices only — a room whose devices are all unauthorized reads `false`)
  - `onlyOn` — `true` keeps only devices whose `switch` currently reads `on` ("what's on right now" in one call); `false` is a no-op
  - `changedSince` — keeps devices with activity at/after the timestamp: epoch ms, or ISO-8601 with a numeric offset in either spelling (`-0600` / `-06:00`, trailing `Z` accepted; offset-less and date-only forms rejected — a returned `lastActivity` round-trips); the inverse of `filter='stale:<hours>'`; never-reported devices are excluded
- **Format shortcuts**: `format='ids'` returns a flat integer array `deviceIds: [1,2,3]` (cheapest shape for "which devices exist" queries). `format='context'` returns a token-cheap plain-text house snapshot in `summary` — a `Mode:`/`HSM:`/`Devices: N of M` header plus one `- Label (id, room) - capabilities; attr=value, ...` line per device, values carrying the reported unit directly appended (`temperature=72.5°F`) — page size 50 unless `limit` set, `nextCursor` emitted when more remain; `attributeNames` projects which attributes appear (context-only, rejected elsewhere; empty array = default set); ignores `fields`; not available with `scope='all'`. The best first call for broad "what's going on in this house" questions
- **Field projection**: `fields=['id','label']` skips `currentStates` and `attributes` (the expensive ones -- they trigger per-device hub reads); `capabilities` and `commands` are in-memory and cheap. Only named fields are populated -- reduces both payload size and hub CPU. Unknown field names throw. `id` is always included regardless of projection.
- With `detailed=true` (or `format='detailed'`), paginate: 20-30 devices per request
- Make tool calls sequentially, not in parallel

**hub_list_device_events:**
- Default limit 10, recommended max 50
- Higher values (100+) may cause delays on busy devices

**hub_get_device_attribute (poll mode):**
- Poll mode activates when any of `expectedValue`/`expectedValues`/`comparator`/`stableForMs`/`timeoutMs`/`pollIntervalMs` is supplied, OR `deviceIds`/`mode` is present (the multi-device keys route on key presence, so a present-but-null `deviceIds`/`mode` still reaches poll mode and is rejected with an actionable null-guard rather than silently falling to a one-shot read). An expected value is REQUIRED in poll mode -- supplying only `comparator`/`stableForMs` (or only a timing arg) still routes to poll mode and is then rejected for the missing `expectedValue`/`expectedValues`. A bare one-shot call (no poll args) still requires `deviceId` -- omitting both `deviceId` and `deviceIds` is rejected with an actionable message. BLOCKS the MCP request up to `timeoutMs` MILLISECONDS (default 5000ms = 5 seconds, max 60000ms = 60 seconds). Use sparingly; prefer event-driven flows when available.
- Concurrent MCP requests queue while this call blocks; avoid parallel poll-mode `hub_get_device_attribute` calls.
- Provide EXACTLY ONE of `expectedValue` or `expectedValues` -- passing both is rejected (same as the `hub_call_device_command` `waitFor` path). For `eq`, a multi-element `expectedValues` set is OR -- the poll succeeds when the value matches ANY member; for `ne`, it succeeds when the value matches NONE of them (it left the whole set). (The numeric comparators below take only `expectedValue`; `between` takes only `expectedValues`.)
- `comparator` (default `eq`) controls the match operator:
  - `eq` / `ne`: string-set membership (`eq` = value IS in the expectedValue/expectedValues set; `ne` = value is NOT in the set). `ne` does not match a null/never-reported value.
  - `gt` / `gte` / `lt` / `lte`: NUMERIC compare of the value (parsed as a decimal) against a single threshold in `expectedValue`. `expectedValues` is rejected for these.
  - `between`: NUMERIC inclusive range `low <= value <= high`, bounds from `expectedValues` (exactly 2 numeric strings `[low, high]`, `low <= high`). `expectedValue` is rejected.
  - Numeric comparators never match a null/non-numeric value -- the poll keeps going (and times out if it never becomes numeric-and-in-range). If the attribute reported a value the whole window but it never parsed numeric (e.g. `gt` on `switch="on"`), the timeout adds `nonNumericAttribute: true` (the comparator can never match -- use `eq`/`ne` for a string attribute).
- `stableForMs` (default 0 = return on first match): the matched condition must hold CONTINUOUSLY for this many MILLISECONDS before the poll converges (debounce). A value that flaps out of the condition restarts the window. Must be `< timeoutMs` (a value `>= timeoutMs` is rejected -- it could never converge). A continuously-flapping value never stabilizes and times out (correct).
- Re-reads the attribute every `pollIntervalMs` MILLISECONDS (default 200ms, min 50ms, max 5000ms)
- Returns `success: true` with `finalValue`, `elapsedMs`, `polledCount`, `timedOut: false` when the value matches
- Returns `success: false` with `timedOut: true` and the last-read `finalValue` on timeout; adds `neverReported: true` if the attribute never returned a non-null value during the entire poll window, or `nonNumericAttribute: true` (with a `note`) if a numeric comparator was used on an attribute that reported a non-numeric value the whole window. Adds `readError: true` (on SUCCESS or timeout) if reading the device threw on any poll (e.g. it was removed mid-poll) -- that tick was treated as unread rather than aborting the poll
- Returns `success: false` with `interrupted: true` (plus `finalValue`, `elapsedMs`, `polledCount`) if the hub interrupted the sleep (e.g. app reload during poll)
- `pollIntervalMs` is automatically clamped to `timeoutMs` if larger, ensuring at least one poll
- For passive one-shot reads, omit `expectedValue`/`expectedValues` (plain read mode) -- poll mode is for waiting on state transitions
- Common pattern after `hub_call_device_command`: its native `state` snapshot is read after dispatch but may still show the previous state until the driver reports the effect. To confirm the resulting state, use the command's `waitFor` argument and check convergence; use this tool separately to poll an attribute another actor is changing.
- `hub_call_device_command`'s `waitFor` reuses this poll engine (including `comparator` and `stableForMs`, same semantics) but caps `timeoutMs` at 30000ms (vs 60000ms here) because it BLOCKS a hub thread for the full timeout while a write is in flight; its `pollIntervalMs` defaults to 250ms (vs 200ms here) since a post-command poll follows a write and wider spacing reduces read contention. A bad `waitFor` spec (including an invalid comparator/stableForMs) is rejected BEFORE the command fires, so the device is not actuated.

**hub_get_device_attribute (multi-device convergence):**
- Pass `deviceIds` (a list of device IDs) instead of `deviceId` to await the condition across SEVERAL devices in one bounded call. `deviceIds` is mutually exclusive with `deviceId` -- provide exactly one (passing both is rejected). Max 20 devices per poll (the cap bounds the per-interval work, since every device is re-read each interval).
- The SAME condition (`attribute`, `comparator`, `expectedValue`/`expectedValues`, `stableForMs`) is applied to every device and validated once. Access and native identity/state availability are checked per device. Native discovery includes reported attributes only: an unset, cleared, or unknown attribute can remain absent and time out rather than being rejected as an unsupported declaration.
- `mode` (default `all`) controls the aggregate: `all` converges when EVERY device matches; `any` converges as soon as ONE device matches. `mode` applies only to `deviceIds` -- passing it with a single `deviceId` is rejected; an invalid value lists `[any, all]`. The aggregate predicate also drives `stableForMs` -- the whole any/all condition must hold continuously for the window. In `all` mode any single device flapping out resets the window (the aggregate goes false). In `any` mode the aggregate stays satisfied while ANY other device still matches, so one device flapping resets the window only when it was the sole match.
- Returns a COMPACT per-device array, never full device objects: `success` (the mode predicate converged), `mode`, `devices: [{deviceId, device, finalValue, matched}, ...]`, `convergedCount` (devices currently matched), `elapsedMs`, `polledCount`, `timedOut`. A device entry adds `readError: true` (on SUCCESS or timeout) if reading THAT device threw on any poll (e.g. it was removed mid-poll) -- only that device's tick degrades to unread; the other devices' state is still returned, the poll never errors out. On TIMEOUT, each device entry also adds `neverReported: true` / `nonNumericAttribute: true` only where true; an aggregate `transitioning` (any device still changing) and a `note` (present when >=1 device is a can-never-match non-numeric) round it out. A hub-reload interrupt returns `interrupted: true` with the per-device array.
- Multi-device is the standalone poll ONLY. `hub_call_device_command`'s `waitFor` stays single-device because it blocks that one command's in-flight write thread. To confirm a multi-device command sequence, fire it with `hub_call_device_command`'s `commands` array (one round trip), then call `hub_get_device_attribute` with `deviceIds` to await the aggregate — `commands` rejects `waitFor` for the same reason, so this pairing is the intended confirmed-multi-device flow.

**hub_get_logs:**
- Returns most recent entries first
- Default 100 entries, max 500
- Filter pipeline order: scope (deviceId/appId, server-side) -> level -> source -> pattern -> patterns -> time window (since/until) -> limit
- `level` and `source` (substring) are simple string filters applied before regex
- `pattern` (string): case-insensitive regex against the message field; compiled once; throws on invalid syntax
- `patterns` (array of strings): multiple regexes; `patternMode='any'` (default) = OR, `patternMode='all'` = AND; compatible with `pattern` (both apply)
- `since` / `until`: ISO-8601 timestamp (e.g. `'2024-01-15T10:30:00Z'`) or relative offset (`'30m'`, `'2h'`, `'1d'`, `'7d'`); relative offset subtracted from now; max 30d (throws if exceeded -- use ISO-8601 for longer ranges); entries with unparseable time fields pass through rather than being excluded. ISO-8601 timestamps without an explicit TZ marker (e.g., `'2024-01-15T10:30:00'` or `'2024-01-15 10:30:00.000'`) are parsed as UTC.
- For single-device or single-app logs, pass `deviceId` or `appId` -- this is a server-side scope filter (mutually exclusive) and is much cheaper than post-filtering the full buffer
- Current three-column hub log rows are decoded as timestamp, level, and source/message; their timestamps use the hub's configured time zone. Older five-column rows retain their UTC interpretation. Explicit time-zone offsets in `since`/`until` are honored.

**hub_get_logs (mode='mcp' or 'status'):**
- Reads structured MCP history; `mode='status'` returns the configured threshold, capacity, and entry counts. Use `hub_get_logs` for the broader native history of apps and devices.
- Debug, info, warn, and error entries admitted by the configured log level are written through Hubitat's native logger. A bounded memory cache serves recent MCP history; after a reload it recovers entries from native Past Logs scoped to this app. Logging does not write a second file or persist the full ring in app state.
- The MCP view holds at most 100 entries. Structured messages retain the existing 500-character limit and exception text the existing 1,000-character limit; diagnostic details are preserved. Native logs retain the full message. Hubitat also prunes its shared Past Logs by size (approximately 1 MB across the hub), so native history may contain fewer MCP entries after a reload. Explicitly purging Hubitat logs removes that recovery source.
- `hub_delete_debug_logs` clears the MCP view using a durable generation marker. Older native log lines remain visible through Hubitat's Logs page and `hub_get_logs`; they do not reappear in the MCP view after a reload.
- Existing stored MCP entries migrate into native logging with their original timestamps and structured fields before their old state copy is removed. Rule filters and bug-report context continue to use the structured entries.

**hub_list_device_events (windowed mode):**
- Windowed mode activates when `hoursBack` OR `since` is supplied: up to 7 days of history
- `hoursBack` is a relative window; `since` is an absolute bookmark -- return only events AFTER an exact timestamp. `since` accepts ISO-8601 in the same format the tool emits in `date`/`sinceTimestamp` -- a numeric offset in either spelling (`-0600` / `-06:00`), e.g. `2026-06-23T10:00:00.000-0600` (a trailing `Z` for UTC and a millis-less variant are also accepted), or epoch milliseconds. `since` takes precedence over `hoursBack`; a future `since` yields an empty list
- **Change-watching loop**: record a returned event `date`, run your action, then pass that `date` back as `since` to get exactly the new events since that bookmark. The response echoes `sinceMode` (`"explicit"` when `since` drove the window, `"relative"` for `hoursBack`) plus the bounding field (`since` or `hoursBack`); `sinceTimestamp` is always the actual window start used
- Use attribute filter to reduce data volume
- **Location-scope mode**: omit `deviceId` to return location events instead of device events. Returns mode changes (`name: 'mode'`), HSM status/alerts (`'hsmStatus'`, `'hsmAlert'`), hub variable changes (name = the variable's name), and any `sendLocationEvent(...)` emissions from rules/apps. `attribute` filter applies to event name in the same way. Response includes `source: 'location'` and omits `device`/`deviceId`.

**hub_get_app_config:**
- projection="ruleStructure" selects the read-only `hubitat.rm.structure` v2 contract: named required expression/triggers, compiled actionList order, allowlisted indexed setting fields and non-string local metadata. Each selected field reports available, absent or withheld; values are source evidence, not normalized actions. Compiled action objects are not description strings. It rejects pageName/summary/includeSettings combinations; no arbitrary settings or local values are returned. Missing source fields are explicit gaps. See docs/rule-structure.md.
- Reads any legacy SmartApp's configuration page: RM rules, Room Lighting instances, Basic Rules, HPM, Mode Manager, Button Controllers, third-party community apps
- Default response includes `app` (identity), `page` (section/input structure with current values), `childApps` summary
- Raw app-internal `settings` map (~100-1000 keys with app-specific encoding) omitted by default — pass `includeSettings=true` for power-user inspection
- Multi-page apps (HPM, multi-page Room Lighting) expose sub-pages via `pageName`. For HPM specifically: `pageName="prefPkgUninstall"` returns the FULL installed-package list as an enum; `pageName="prefPkgModify"` returns only the subset with optional components; `pageName="prefOptions"` is the main menu (navigation links, no package data).
- Read-only, does not modify anything. Gated by the Read master.

## Installed-App & Native-Rule Tools

The installed-apps reads (`hub_list_apps` scope=instances, `hub_list_device_dependents`, `hub_get_app_config`, `hub_list_app_pages`, `hub_list_hpm_packages`) live in the `hub_read_apps_code` gateway; the native-app CRUD is split across `hub_manage_native_rules_and_apps` (generic classic apps via `hub_set_native_app`, plus delete/clone/export/import) and `hub_manage_rule_machine` (RM rule authoring via `hub_set_rule`, plus the Visual Rules Builder tools `hub_get_visual_rule` / `hub_set_visual_rule` / `hub_delete_visual_rule`). All of these are gated by the universal masters: the installed-app reads (and the native-rule reads like `hub_list_rules`) are gated by the **Read master**, and the native-app CRUD path (`hub_set_rule`, `hub_set_native_app`, `hub_delete_native_app`, etc.) by the **Write master** — the destructive CRUD additionally enforces `confirm=true` + a hub backup within 24h. If the user sees "Read tools are disabled" or "Write tools are disabled" errors, direct them to the MCP Rule Server app settings page to turn the relevant master back ON (both default ON). If a destructive write blocks with a backup-age message, use `hub_create_backup` first. A tool can also be switched off individually under **Advanced: Per-tool Overrides** — that path returns "…is disabled in Advanced settings (Per-tool Overrides)…" and is re-enabled in the same settings page.

### Installed-app reads (in `hub_read_apps_code`)

- **`hub_list_apps` (scope=instances)** — enumerate ALL apps on the hub (built-in + user) with parent/child tree (the former `hub_list_installed_apps`, now folded into `hub_list_apps`; pass `scope='instances'`, default `scope='types'` returns the installable-app catalog)
  - `filter="all"` (default) | `"builtin"` | `"user"` | `"disabled"` | `"parents"` | `"children"`
  - Each entry: `id`, `name`, `type`, `disabled`, `user`, `hidden`, `parentId`, `hasChildren`, `childCount`
  - Built-in apps have `user=false` (Rule Machine, Room Lighting, Groups and Scenes, Mode Manager, HSM, Dashboards, Maker API, etc.)
  - User apps have `user=true` (Awair, Ecobee, HPM, etc.)
  - Parent/child tree flattened with `parentId` pointers. Hidden parents are excluded from output but their children are promoted to the nearest visible ancestor (or `null` at root).

- **`hub_list_device_dependents`** — find apps that reference a specific device
  - Use BEFORE deleting a device, disabling a device, or troubleshooting unexpected behavior
  - Returns `appsUsing` array with each app's `id`, `name` (type like "Room Lights" or "Rule-5.1"), `label` (user-visible), `trueLabel` (HTML-stripped), `disabled`
  - Answers "if I delete/disable this device, which automations break?"

- **`hub_get_app_config`** — read an installed app's configuration page (Read master)
  - See usage tips above for full details on response shape, pageName navigation, and includeSettings flag
  - Workflow: `hub_list_apps` (scope=instances) or `hub_list_rules` to find an `appId`, then `hub_get_app_config` to inspect it

- **`hub_list_app_pages`** — list known page names for a multi-page app (Read master)
  - Returns the primary page (introspected from the hub) plus a curated directory of known sub-pages for well-known app types
  - Curated directories: HPM (prefOptions, prefPkgUninstall, prefPkgModify, prefPkgInstall, prefPkgMatchUp), RM rules (mainPage only -- single-page), Room Lighting (mainPage), Mode Manager (mainPage)
  - Unknown app types: returns the primary page only plus a note about consulting the app's source or Web UI for additional page names
  - Use this before `hub_get_app_config` on multi-page apps to avoid guessing page names
  - Args: `appId` (required)

### HPM package introspection — `hub_list_hpm_packages` (in `hub_read_apps_code`)

HPM package state introspection. The tool is gated by the **Read master** and HPM itself must be installed on the hub. Auto-discovers HPM's installed-app ID unless `hpmAppId` is supplied explicitly. All `IllegalArgumentException`s raised (multi-instance throw, wrong app type, missing HPM, non-numeric `hpmAppId`) are surfaced by the MCP dispatcher as JSON-RPC error `-32602` "Invalid params" -- the response is a JSON-RPC error, **not** a tool-result map with `success=false`.

**`actualTypeName` diagnostic label sets — two distinct enums:** HPM tooling reports the parsed-JSON runtime type via an `actualTypeName` token at two distinct sites with different label sets. (1) `_hpmFetchManifests` parse-shape errors (surfaced as JSON-RPC `-32602` "Unexpected HPM statusJson shape" / "Unexpected HPM manifests shape"): `<actualTypeName>` is one of `List`, `null`, or `non-object` (any non-Map, non-List, non-null scalar). (2) `orphanDetection` / `orphanDriverDetection` registry-shape errors (surfaced in `reason` strings on a `success=true` response with `enabled=false`): `<actualTypeName>` is one of `Map`, `null`, or `unknown` (any non-List, non-null, non-Map shape). The label sets diverge because the expected shape at each site is different (a Map for statusJson, a List for the registries).

- **`hub_list_hpm_packages`** — return all packages tracked by Hubitat Package Manager with full component inventory
  - Each package: `manifestUrl`, `packageName`, `version`, `beta`, `author`, `apps[]`, `drivers[]`, `files[]`
  - Each app/driver component: `id` (UUID from manifest), `name`, `heID` (Hubitat code ID or null if not installed), `required`, `version`; if `heID` is an empty/whitespace-only string it is cleared to null and `_warning` is added (e.g. `"empty heID string '' normalized to null"` for an empty string, or `"empty heID string '  ' normalized to null"` for a whitespace-only string); if `heID` is a whitespace-padded string (e.g. `' 142 '`) it is normalized to the trimmed value and `_warning` records the normalization (e.g. `"whitespace-padded heID ' 142 ' normalized to '142'"`); heID remains non-null; if `heID` is a non-scalar type it is cleared to null and `_warning` is added
  - `files[]` entries have no `heID` (File Manager assets tracked by name only)
  - Top-level `count` (number of packages returned); `hpmAppId` (HPM's installed-app ID, echoed so callers can cache it and skip discovery on subsequent calls)
  - Top-level `skippedMalformed[]`: manifest URLs whose value was not a Map (package skipped entirely)
  - Per-package `skippedAppCount`, `skippedDriverCount`, `skippedFileCount` (each omitted when 0): counts of app/driver/file entries that were not Maps
  - Auto-discovers HPM if `hpmAppId` omitted; when multiple HPM instances are detected, throws with a bracketed ID list capped at 10 entries with `"and N more (total M)"` suffix; when `hpmAppId` is supplied explicitly but points at an app that is not Hubitat Package Manager, throws `IllegalArgumentException` with the actual type disclosed (e.g. `"hpmAppId N is not Hubitat Package Manager (actual type: Simple Automation Rules)"`)
  - Use to audit what HPM-managed code is on the hub and compare against expected packages

- **`hub_list_hpm_packages` with `includeDrift=true`** — also cross-reference HPM-tracked state against what is actually installed; drift results nest under a `drift` key on the response
  - Currently the only drift signal types are: `missing-required` (required=true, heID null), `orphan-app` (heID present but app code no longer in Apps Code registry), `orphan-driver` (heID present but driver code no longer in Drivers Code registry). Data-quality issues are emitted in a separate `dataQualityWarnings[]` aggregate and do NOT inflate `totalDriftSignals`.
  - Optional `packageFilter` (case-insensitive substring) narrows to specific packages
  - Auto-discovers HPM if `hpmAppId` omitted (including the multi-instance throw with up to 10 ids and `"and N more (total M)"` suffix); when `hpmAppId` is supplied explicitly but points at an app that is not Hubitat Package Manager, throws `IllegalArgumentException` with the actual type disclosed (e.g. `"hpmAppId N is not Hubitat Package Manager (actual type: Simple Automation Rules)"`)
  - Response: `hpmAppId` (echoed, same semantics as `hub_list_hpm_packages`); `packagesChecked` (not `count`) **because** `packageFilter` may narrow the set examined -- 'checked' reflects the filtered population, distinguishing it from `hub_list_hpm_packages`'s naive `count`; `packagesWithActionableDrift` (count of packages with at least one actionable signal -- excludes data-quality-only packages); `totalDriftSignals` (actionable drift only -- missing-required, orphan-app, orphan-driver -- does NOT count data-quality warnings); `drift[]` (one entry per package with any signal or warning -- each has `manifestUrl`, `packageName`, `version`, `signals[]`, and optionally `dataQualityWarnings[]`, `skippedAppCount`, `skippedDriverCount`); `summary` sentence. Note: `drift[].length` may exceed `packagesWithActionableDrift` when data-quality-only packages exist -- those entries appear for visibility but are not counted in the summary.
  - Each `signals[]` entry has: `type`, `componentType`, `componentName`, `componentId`, `note`. `orphan-app` and `orphan-driver` entries additionally carry `heID` (the orphaned id); `missing-required` entries omit `heID` (the value is null by definition of the signal). If the manifest carried a non-null but invalid heID (e.g. whitespace-padded `"  "`) that was normalized to null, the original raw value is recoverable from the sibling `dataQualityWarnings[]` entry -- join on `(componentType, componentName, componentId)`. `skipped-malformed-component` warnings cannot be joined because they lack `componentName`/`componentId`.
  - If any data-quality warnings exist across packages, they are also aggregated at top-level `result.dataQualityWarnings[]`
  - `orphanDetection` (`{enabled, reason?}`) -- `enabled=false` means the Apps Code registry fetch failed; `reason` discloses whether the body was empty ("Empty response from /hub2/userAppTypes") or had an unexpected shape ("expected JSON array, got `<actualTypeName>`: ..."). `<actualTypeName>` is one of: `Map`, `null`, or `unknown` (any non-List, non-null, non-Map shape -- the parsed JSON's runtime type). When the payload preview exceeds 200 chars, `reason` truncates to 200 and appends `" (truncated)"`
  - `orphanDriverDetection` (`{enabled, reason?}`) -- same structure as `orphanDetection` but for the Drivers Code registry (`/hub2/userDeviceTypes`)
  - When one detection system is disabled the `summary` appends `"(partial: <name> disabled this call -- see <name> reason)"`; when both are disabled the suffix uses `"reasons"` (plural): `"(partial: orphanDetection/orphanDriverDetection disabled this call -- see orphanDetection/orphanDriverDetection reasons)"`. Note: when `orphanDetection.enabled` or `orphanDriverDetection.enabled` is `false`, the corresponding orphan-* signals cannot fire. `packagesWithActionableDrift` will reflect only packages with a `missing-required` signal, and may UNDER-COUNT the actual drift state. Inspect `orphanDetection` / `orphanDriverDetection` before treating `packagesWithActionableDrift == 0` as 'clean'.
  - Separately, a `required=true` component whose heID is non-scalar (List/Map/Boolean) produces a `heid-non-scalar-dropped` data-quality warning rather than a `missing-required` signal. The component is dropped before the required check, so a broken-but-required component will not contribute to `packagesWithActionableDrift`. Inspect `dataQualityWarnings[]` for `heid-non-scalar-dropped` entries on required components before treating a zero count as fully clean.
  - Data-quality issues land in `dataQualityWarnings[]` on the per-package entry and are aggregated at top-level `result.dataQualityWarnings[]` -- they do NOT inflate `totalDriftSignals`. Currently the only data-quality warning types are: `heid-whitespace-normalized` (whitespace-padded heID normalized to trimmed value; component is **kept**, drift checks continue against the trimmed heID), `heid-non-scalar-dropped` (heID is not a Number or String; component is **dropped**, no drift checks run), `empty-heid` (blank heID normalized to null; entry has `componentName`, `componentId`, `_warning`), `skipped-malformed-component` (non-Map component entry; entry has only `type`, `componentType`, `_warning` -- no `componentName`/`componentId` because the source was not a Map). The kept/dropped distinction lets consumers determine whether drift checks ran for a given component.
  - Files are not checked for drift **because** HPM tracks file components by name only (no heID), so there is no registry membership to verify; `skippedFileCount` is accordingly not emitted on drift entries
  - Top-level `skippedMalformed[]`: manifest URLs whose value was not a Map (symmetric with `hub_list_hpm_packages`)
  - When `packageFilter` matched nothing: `filterMatchedZero=true` plus `availablePackages[]` for filter-spelling sanity check; in this case `packagesChecked == 0` and `summary` reads `"No drift detected across 0 tracked packages."`
  - Limitation: heID-presence-only. HPM stores no source hashes, so post-install edits via `hub_update_app` are not detectable.
  - Example call: `hub_read_apps_code(tool="hub_list_hpm_packages", args={includeDrift: true, packageFilter: "BOND"})` — checks drift for only packages whose name contains "BOND"
  - Design note: the base package inventory emits `_warning` inline on each component **because** consumers typically enumerate components per-package; the `includeDrift=true` output emits `dataQualityWarnings[]` as a separate aggregate **because** consumers need to distinguish actionable drift signals from data-quality issues without conflating them in a single `signals[]` count

### hub_manage_native_rules_and_apps (11 tools)

Two surfaces under one gateway: RMUtils-based runtime control for RM rules (RM-only because RMUtils is RM-only) plus admin-layer CRUD that works uniformly across any classic SmartApp (RM, Room Lighting, Button Controllers, Basic Rules, Notifier, etc.). The four RMUtils control tools below are ALSO surfaced (alongside `hub_get_rule_health`) in the `hub_manage_rule_machine` gateway; the read-only members (`hub_list_rules`, `hub_get_rule_health`) additionally appear in `hub_read_rules`.

**RMUtils control (4 tools, RM-only):**

- **`hub_list_rules`** — enumerate Rule Machine rules (RM 4.x + 5.x combined, deduplicated by id). Each rule carries a live `status` (`active` | `paused` | `stopped` | `disabled` | `unknown`) plus `disabled`/`paused` booleans and, when detected, `requiredExpressionFalse: true`. `disabled` is the red-X flag; `paused` is decoration-detected from /hub2/appsList; `stopped` is decoration-detected by the same appsList-vs-label diff (so a rule literally NAMED "... (Stopped)" is not false-flagged) and appears only when the hub's list source decorates the label (many firmwares don't) — the AUTHORITATIVE stopped check is `hub_get_rule_health`'s `stopped` field; a detected "(Stopped)" suffix is stripped from returned label/name. Precedence governs only the `status` summary (disabled > stopped > paused > active); the `disabled`/`paused` booleans remain independent facts. `unknown` is per-rule: tree-level (`/hub2/appsList` unreadable → whole list, with a result-level `statusNote`) or per-entry (one rule's node under-populated → just that rule, others stay determinate); either way the booleans are omitted, never asserted false. For non-RM classic apps use `hub_list_apps` (scope='instances'). Full semantics: `hub_get_tool_guide(section='builtin_app_tools_rules')`.
- **`hub_call_rule`** — trigger an existing RM rule via `RMUtils.sendAction`
  - `action="rule"` (default, full evaluation): runs triggers + conditions + actions as if the rule fired
  - `action="actions"`: runs only the actions, bypassing conditions (useful for manual override)
  - `action="stop"`: stops running actions (cancels in-flight delays)
- **`hub_set_rule_paused`** — reversible toggle (`paused=true` pauses / `false` resumes); paused rules don't fire on triggers
- **`hub_set_rule_private_boolean`** — set an RM rule's private boolean (true or false only; string values must be lowercase `"true"`/`"false"`). RM rules can use "Private Boolean" in conditions — this lets MCP flip that flag from outside.

**Admin-layer CRUD (7 tools, generic across all classic SmartApps):**

(`hub_set_native_app`, `hub_set_app_disabled`, `hub_delete_native_app`, `hub_clone_native_app`, `hub_export_native_app`, `hub_import_native_app`, `hub_get_rule_health`. `hub_set_rule` is referenced below for create+edit context but lives in `hub_manage_rule_machine`.)

If a user asks "create a new RM rule" or "modify this Room Lighting instance":

1. **`hub_set_rule(appId?, addTrigger|addAction|..., confirm)`** — create+edit upsert for Rule Machine rules (lives in `hub_manage_rule_machine`). Omit `appId` to create a new RM 5.1 rule; pass it to edit an existing one. Carries the FAT RM authoring schema (`addTrigger`, `addAction`, `addRequiredExpression`, `replaceRequiredExpression`, `walkStep`, `patches`, `replaceActions`, `removeAction`, `clearActions`, `moveAction`, `removeTrigger`, `modifyTrigger`, `modifyAction`, `addLocalVariable`, `removeLocalVariable`). **Create-arm bundle (no `appId`)**: bundles `addTrigger`/`addTriggers`/`addAction`/`addActions`/`addRequiredExpression` to populate the new rule in one call (the bundled RE's outcome is surfaced under `result.requiredExpression`). The remaining edit-only shortcuts (`replaceRequiredExpression`/`walkStep`/`patches`/`replaceActions`/`removeAction`/`clearActions`/`moveAction`/`removeTrigger`/`modifyTrigger`/`modifyAction`/`addLocalVariable`/`removeLocalVariable`) make no sense on a brand-new rule and are LOUDLY REJECTED on create (never silently dropped to an empty shell) -- create the rule first, then re-call with the returned `appId`. Existing-rule edits ensure a recent baseline; same-rule baselines are reused for one hour unless the Advanced per-write toggle is enabled.
2. **`hub_set_native_app(appId?, appType, name, settings|button|buttonRule|walkStep, ...)`** — create+edit upsert for any classic SmartApp (Button Controller, Notifier, Groups+Scenes, Basic Rules; lives in `hub_manage_native_rules_and_apps`; Visual Rules are edit/delete-only by appId — create them with `hub_set_visual_rule`). Omit `appId` to create (`appType` enum-driven; expand `_appTypeRegistry` for other types), pass it to modify by appId. Create a **Button Rule** (a grandchild of a Button Controller) via `buttonRule={controllerId, buttonNumber, event}` — it routes through the controller's add-button flow and returns `buttonRuleId` (then author its actions via `hub_set_rule`). `walkStep` (a generic classic-page walker) and the RM authoring shortcuts also work here on EDIT (`appId` present) for RM-wire-format classic apps -- the create arm honors none of them and loudly rejects rather than drops; the schema stays lean (no FAT trigger/action sugar). Multi-device capability `multiple=true` contract emitted automatically. Existing-app edits use the same recent-baseline policy as `hub_set_rule`.
3. **`hub_set_app_disabled(appId, disabled)`** — enable or disable any installed app (the red-X toggle) via POST `/installedapp/disable`; reversible (no confirm/backup needed). Read-back verified.
4. **`hub_delete_native_app(appId, force, confirm)`** — soft delete (default) or `force=true` for `forcedelete/quiet` (the path the hub UI uses). Auto-snapshots first.
5. **`hub_clone_native_app(appId, newName, stageDisabled?, confirm)`** — clone an existing classic SmartApp via Hubitat's `appCloner` endpoint (deep: child apps and pause state copy too, so a clone of an ACTIVE app lands ACTIVE). `stageDisabled=true` disables the clone and every descendant immediately. NOTE (verified live): RM silently no-ops delete-class wizard clicks on a disabled app -- to edit a staged clone (removeAction/replaceActions/modifyAction), enable it, edit, re-disable. Returns the new `appId`.
6. **`hub_export_native_app(appId)`** — export a classic SmartApp to JSON (round-trippable with `hub_import_native_app`). Useful for the export-mutate-import editing pattern when the wizard surface is too lossy to drive directly.
7. **`hub_import_native_app(jsonContent | fromFile, parentHintAppId, newName?, stageDisabled?, confirm)`** — import previously-exported app JSON into a new instance (the import lands ACTIVE). `stageDisabled=true` disables the import and every descendant immediately. Returns the new `appId`.

Clone/import require a readable parent child-app snapshot before creation; a refusal says nothing was created and can be retried after restoring access. Discovery never guesses among ambiguous new children. If modern staging reaches its continuation limit, the terminal error retains newAppId, stagedDisabled, stageFailures and stageRemaining from the last slice. Disable the remaining/failed apps directly; do not repeat creation.
8. **`hub_get_rule_health(appId, source)`** — read-only health check on any installed app, across **both** rule engines. For a Rule Machine rule it prefers the compiled-state `broken` boolean (`GET /app/ruleBuilderJson`), with the HTML render scan retained as a cross-check and fallback (broken markers — with per-marker occurrence counts in `brokenMarkerCounts` — multiple-flag poison, configPage errors, structural imbalance, compiled `predicate`). For a **Visual Rules Builder** rule it reports the engine-native health: a graph rule's `validationErrors` (`GET /app/ruleBuilder20Json`) become `broken=true` when non-empty; a classic VRB rule is recognized (`ruleFormat="vrb-classic"`) with no compiled boolean. Other classic apps (Button Controller, Basic Rule, …) share RM's configPage protocol, so the configPage checks (e.g. `configPage.error`, multiple-flag poison) cover them too — they report `ruleFormat` `button-controller` / `basic-rule` / `classic-app` with `broken: null` (no compiled boolean). The `ruleFormat` field says what was inspected. The always-present `unreadable` flag distinguishes couldn't-check from checked-and-broken: `ok=false` + `unreadable=true` means NEITHER source could be read (transient failure, or the app does not exist) — no evidence of breakage either way. When exactly ONE source fails to read while the other reads clean, `ok` reflects what WAS read and the always-present `checkErrors` array names the failed leg (a half-checked verdict — re-run for a full one). `source` defaults to `auto` (runs both paths + the cross-check); pass `ruleBuilderJson` or `configPage` to force a single path. Pause state is true/false/null (unknown), using compiled Boolean state then status state or tagged runtime decoration. Explicit stopped state takes precedence over display markup. Bare `(Paused)` and `(Stopped)` name suffixes remain literal text. Visual Rule names come from the raw builder document unless `configPage` is forced. The standalone read adds live subscription/job counts, stopped, and status/markup pause fallbacks; embedded write-response health carries the structural verdict and compiled paused only. `hub_set_rule` attaches the embedded verdict as `health` on every response (success AND error); `hub_set_visual_rule` attaches it on every response that resolves to a rule id (early CREATE failures carry no appId).

**Cross-references** (live in other gateways but commonly used together):
- **`hub_list_rule_local_variables`** (in `hub_read_rules` and `hub_manage_rule_machine`) — read-only list of a Rule Machine rule's LOCAL variables (the per-rule variables created via `hub_set_rule` `addLocalVariable` / `removeLocalVariable` — distinct from hub-global variables, which `hub_list_variables` covers). Reads `state.allLocalVars` from the rule's statusJson appState; returns `{appId, localVariables:[{name, type, value}], total}`. Use to confirm a local exists (and its type) before targeting it with the `setLocalVariable` action or `removeLocalVariable` shortcut. The `type` is the INTERNAL token, which differs from the `addLocalVariable` `type` enum — translate when piping list output back into `addLocalVariable`: **Number->`integer`, Decimal->`bigdecimal`, String->`string`, Boolean->`boolean`, DateTime->`datetime`**.
- **`hub_get_app_config`** (in `hub_read_apps_code`) — read any installed app's current page schema, settings, and child apps. Use BEFORE every `hub_set_rule` / `hub_set_native_app` edit to discover the right input names.
- **`hub_list_backups`** (in `hub_read_apps_code` / `hub_manage_backup`) + **`hub_restore_backup`** (in `hub_manage_backup`) — enumerate and restore native-app snapshots (`type="rm-rule"` entries). Restore re-applies settings in place if the app exists, or recreates the app and replays settings if it was deleted.

**Basic Rules** are registered: `hub_set_native_app(appType="basic_rule", name=...)` creates one via generic `createchild`, and editing its settings works cleanly (Basic Rule is a submitOnChange classic app — `commitButton` is null in the registry so no spurious `updateRule` click poisons its render). **Button Rules** are grandchildren of a Button Controller and can't be created standalone — use `buttonRule` (on `hub_set_native_app` or `hub_set_rule`), which drives the controller's add-button flow and returns the new rule's `appId`; then author its actions with `hub_set_rule(appId=<buttonRuleId>, addAction=...)`. For Room Lighting and other not-yet-registered types, `hub_set_native_app` (edit) and `hub_delete_native_app` already work by appId; creation needs the `_appTypeRegistry()` entry (namespace + appName + parentTypeName, verified live). If a registered type's built-in **parent** app isn't installed on the hub (e.g. a fresh hub with no Button Controllers), creation self-bootstraps it via the "Add Built-In App" endpoint (`GET /installedapp/sysApp/<parentTypeName>`) and retries — no manual install needed.

#### `hub_set_rule` capability reference

Reference for the `hub_set_rule` structured shortcuts (`addTrigger`, `addAction`, `addRequiredExpression`). The schema descriptions point here so flat-mode `tools/list` can stay under the 124 KB cap; gateway-mode catalog responses still carry the full enumerations inline. For machine-readable schemas, pass `{discover: true}` on `addTrigger` or `addAction` -- both return live structured Maps from the running code.

To READ a rule's current configuration -- before an edit to discover the right input names, or to verify after a write -- use `hub_read_apps_code -> hub_get_app_config(appId)`. It is NOT in the `hub_manage_rule_machine` / `hub_manage_native_rules_and_apps` rule gateways; the rule-read tool lives in `hub_read_apps_code`.

##### `addTrigger` capability families

- **Device-state** (Switch / Motion / Contact / Lock / Garage / Door / Valve / Window Shade / Presence / Power source): `capability`, `deviceIds`, `state` (`'on'`, `'active'`, `'open'`, `'unlocked'`, etc.). To fire on ANY change of the attribute (not one specific value) pass `comparator:'*changed*'` and OMIT `state`: a device-state trigger has no separate comparator field, so the change token rides the value picker (`tstate<N>`) and renders e.g. "Switch changed". A bare change token in `state` (`state:'changed'`) is rejected fail-loud, steering you to `comparator:'*changed*'`.
- **Multi-device "all of these"**: add `allOfThese=true` to the device-state spec
- **Numeric** (Temperature / Humidity / Battery / Illuminance / Power / Energy / CO2 / Dimmer / Thermostat setpoints): `capability`, `deviceIds`, `comparator` (`=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `*changed*`), `value`
- **Button** (`capability='Button'`): `deviceIds`, `buttonNumber`, `state` (`pushed` | `held` | `doubleTapped` | `released`)
- **Custom Attribute** (`capability='Custom Attribute'`): `deviceIds`, `attribute` (the attribute name), `comparator`, `value`
- **And-stays sticky modifier** (any device-state or numeric trigger): add `andStays={hours, minutes, seconds}` to the spec
- **Time / Sunrise / Sunset** (`capability='Certain Time (and optional date)'`): `time` (`'A specific time'` | `'Sunrise'` | `'Sunset'`), `atTime`, `offset` (minutes, for sunrise/sunset)
  - `atTime` semantic: `'HH:mm'` form (e.g. `'17:00'`) = **DAILY-recurring** trigger that fires every day at that wall-clock time. Full ISO datetime (e.g. `'2026-04-29T17:00:00'` or `'2026-04-29T17:00:00.000-0500'`) = **ONE-SHOT dated** trigger that fires once on that specific date. Forms without timezone are auto-normalized to hub local tz; explicit-offset and Zulu forms are normalized to UTC equivalent.
- **Mode** (`capability='Mode'`): `state='Night'` OR `state=['Away','Night']` (mode names, case-insensitive) OR `modeIds=['3']` OR `modeIds=['3','5']` (IDs directly, from `hub_list_modes`).
  - **IMPORTANT:** writes `modesX<N>` internally — do NOT pass `tstate` or `rawSettings.tstate` for Mode triggers (silently ignored; renders as Broken Trigger). Use `hub_list_modes` to list valid mode names/IDs.
- **Periodic Schedule** (`capability='Periodic Schedule'`): recurring schedule via the dedicated periodic sub-page. Spec:
  ```
  periodic={
    frequency: 'Seconds'|'Minutes'|'Hourly'|'Daily'|'Weekly'|'Monthly'|'Yearly'|'Cron String',
    everyN: <int>,                 // "every N <unit>" mode (Seconds/Minutes/Hourly/Daily)
                                   //   REQUIRED even when =1 for Daily AND Hourly (omitting renders null)
                                   //   Seconds/Minutes: whole number from [1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30] (firmware-imposed; Hourly/Daily accept any positive integer; fractional truncates, 5.5->5)
    startingTime: 'HH:mm',         // start-time (Hourly/Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Yearly; Seconds has none); for Hourly-everyN, pass it (omitting renders a cosmetic trailing "starting at " blank)
    weekdaysOnly: <bool>,          // Daily-only
    selectedHours: [9,12],         // Hourly-only, alternative to everyN
    selectedMinutes: [0,30],       // Minutes-only, "at specific minutes", alternative to everyN
    selectedDaysOfMonth: [1,15],   // Daily-only, alternative to everyN/weekdays
    daysOfWeek: ['Monday','Friday'], // Weekly-only, MULTI day-of-week
    dayOfWeek: 'Monday',           // Monthly/Yearly nth-weekday, SINGLE day-of-week (distinct from daysOfWeek)
    dayOfMonth: <int>,             // Monthly by-day "on day number" (pair with everyNMonths; exclusive with weekOfMonth)
    everyNMonths: <int>,           // "of every N months" (Monthly, both modes; free integer)
    months: 'December',            // Yearly only -- single nth-weekday month (String); Monthly does NOT take months
    weekOfMonth: 'First',          // Monthly/Yearly nth-weekday: First|Second|Third|Fourth|Last (presence selects nth-weekday)
    minutesOffset: <int>,          // Hourly-only, when not using everyN (startingHCX1)
    cronString: '0 * * * *',       // Cron String mode
    rawSettings: {…}               // escape hatch for periodic-page fields not yet mapped
  }
  ```
  **Monthly has two mutually-exclusive modes:** *by-day* (`dayOfMonth` + `everyNMonths` -- BOTH required or the row renders `null`) and *nth-weekday* (`weekOfMonth` + `dayOfWeek` + `everyNMonths` -- e.g. "the Second Monday of every month"). Passing both `dayOfMonth` and `weekOfMonth` is rejected. Monthly "specific months" ("on day N of selected months") is NOT yet supported (an order-sensitive third sub-mode) -- use `rawSettings`. **Yearly is ALWAYS nth-weekday:** `weekOfMonth` + `dayOfWeek` + single `months` (e.g. "the First Monday of December"); the month alone never completes, because RM 5.1 exposes no by-day calendar-day field for Yearly -- only the nth-weekday picker. **Seconds** exposes only the count enum -- no toggle, no `startingTime`. The Seconds/Minutes restricted enum is firmware-imposed; Hourly/Daily `everyN` accept any positive integer. A `Periodic Schedule` with no `periodic` map is rejected up front (`success=false`, naming any stray top-level keys) rather than committing a phantom `?` row. The tool walks the periodic sub-page (`whichPeriod<N>` → `everyN`/select → time → Done, where `<N>` is the per-trigger sub-page index) so the trigger description bakes correctly. A Seconds/Minutes `everyN` outside the restricted enum, or a Monthly `dayOfMonth`+`weekOfMonth` combo, is rejected with `success=false` and a structured error (the whole-tool backup-and-catch envelope surfaces the validation failure as a structured map, not a thrown -32602).

  **Fail-loud shape guards** (both reject before any hub write, returning `success=false` with a structured error rather than committing a broken trigger): (1) a state-change token supplied as `state` with no `comparator` (e.g. `state:'changed'`/`'increased'` on a device-state or numeric trigger) is rejected and steered to `comparator:'*changed*'`; **Mode / Variable / Custom Attribute are exempt** because their `state` legitimately carries a mode name or an enum value. (2) A `Periodic Schedule` with no `periodic` map is rejected, naming the stray top-level keys you passed instead.

  **Fail-loud `addAction` shape guards** (both reject before any hub write -- "RM is not touched"): (1) a condition-bearing action subtype (`ifThen`/`elseIf`/`repeatWhile`/`waitExpression`, matched case-insensitively) passed a flat top-level `conditions` array is steered to the `expression:{conditions:[...], operator|operators}` wrapper; (2) an action-driven capability (any capability whose action schema exposes an `action` enum -- switch/dimmer/color/colorTemp/lock/shade/fan/button/..., plus the `Window Shade` display name) passed a trigger-style `state:` instead of `action:` is steered to `action:`.

  **Did-you-mean on unknown capability names:** an unknown capability on `addTrigger`, `addRequiredExpression`, `ifThen`/`elseIf`/`repeatWhile`/`waitExpression`, or `waitEvents` fails loud with a closest-match suggestion drawn from the live picker's own option list (so the suggested name is one the picker actually accepts).

  **Comma-joined mode steer:** a mode passed as a single comma-joined string (`state:'Day,Evening'`) is steered to the list shape (`state:['Day','Evening']`) instead of an opaque "unknown mode", across the trigger Mode path, per-mode actions, the `mode` action, and Mode conditions.

- **Inline conditional trigger** (`trigger.condition` Map): `{capability, deviceIds?, state?, comparator?, value?, attribute?, variable?, compareToVariable?, not?, rawSettings?}`. Drives the conditional-trigger sub-wizard inline (sets `isCondTrig.<N>=true` + `condTrig.<N>=a` + the condition fields + clicks hasAll). Convenience: pass singular `deviceId: N` (integer) instead of `deviceIds: [N]` (array) -- the dispatcher normalizes before writing. If both `deviceId` and `deviceIds` are supplied, `deviceIds` wins.
  - The following per-capability extended shapes work on `trigger.condition`: Variable (incl. `compareToVariable`), Custom Attribute (`attribute` + `comparator` + `state`/`value`), and enum/numeric device-state conditions. **Mode-via-picker (`modeIds`), Between two times (`start`/`end`), and `compareToDevice` Maps are NOT yet supported on `trigger.condition`** -- `_rmBuildCondition` is a static direct-write helper, not the shared `_rmWalkConditionReveal` walker. For those shapes use `addRequiredExpression.conditions[]` or `addAction.expression.conditions[]` instead. The time/date-window capabilities reject fail-loud rather than committing a broken condition: `Between two times` steers you to `addRequiredExpression` or an `ifThen` action (where its start/end time-picker walk IS implemented), and `Between two dates` / `Days of week` / `On a Day` -- whose date/day pickers are unmodelled on EVERY structured condition surface -- steer you to author them directly via `rawSettings` or a `walkStep` call. A state-change comparator (`*changed*`/`*became*`) on a device-state condition capability (with no explicit value) is also rejected on every condition surface and steered to a trigger row -- conditions are point-in-time, so a change comparator has no meaning there.
  - `compareToVariable` (Variable LHS compared to another hub variable) works on `addTrigger.condition`, `addRequiredExpression`, AND `addAction` IF-expressions (ifThen/elseIf/repeatWhile/waitExpression). On `addTrigger.condition` the `selectTriggers` sub-wizard writes the fixed `xVarR_<N>` field; on the walker pages (STPage/doActPage) the walker toggles `isVar_<N>=true` and discovers the firmware-assigned right-hand variable picker from the live schema (it does NOT hardcode `xVarR_<N>` -- `selectTriggers` consistently exposes `xVarR`, but the walker pages can expose a differently-suffixed field, so the walker discovers whatever the live schema reveals). On Variable conditions, for value-comparison comparators (`=`/`!=`/`<`/`>`/`<=`/`>=`) supply exactly one of `value`/`state` (constant RHS) or `compareToVariable` (variable RHS) -- they are mutually exclusive; passing both is rejected. State-change comparators (`*changed*`/`*became*`) take no RHS, so omit both. If the revealed RHS picker has an empty option list, the name is written best-effort and `settingsSkipped` carries a `compareToVariable-validation` / `api_unavailable` sentinel (`partial=true`).

##### `addAction` capability families

For machine-readable per-field schemas (with `action` enums and per-action required fields), see `docs/rm_action_subtype_schemas.md` — a hand-maintained copy; keep it in step with `_rmActionSchemaForDiscover()`.

- **Switch** (`capability='switch'`): `action='on'`/`'off'`/`'toggle'`/`'flash'` + `deviceIds`. `action='setPerMode' + deviceIds + perMode={modeIdOrName: 'on'|'off', ...}`. `action='choosePerMode' + perMode={modeIdOrName: {on: [devIds], off: [devIds]}, ...}`. Optional `onlyOn` (Boolean, on/off only): RM's "command only switches that are on?" toggle -- when true the command reaches ONLY switches currently ON (`off` skips already-off switches; `on` is a no-op refresh of already-on ones).
  - **NOTE:** `action='flash'` starts a flash schedule on devices that support `.flash()` (Hue groups, many Z-Wave/Zigbee dimmer modules). RM 5.1 has NO native "stop flash" action subtype — calling `switch.on`/`.off` afterward does NOT cancel the flash schedule. To stop a running flash from within a rule, use `capability='runCommand'` with `command='flashOff'` on the same device list.
- **Dimmer** (`capability='dimmer'`):
  - `setLevel` + `deviceIds` + `level` (0–100) [required] + optional `fadeSeconds`
  - `toggle` + `deviceIds` + `level` (0–100) [required — the level to set when toggling from off to on] + optional `fadeSeconds`
  - `adjust` + `deviceIds` + `adjustBy` (-100..100) [required] + optional `fadeSeconds`
  - `fade` + `deviceIds` + `targetLevel` [required] + `minutes` [required] + `direction='raise'|'lower'` + optional `intervalSeconds`
  - `stopFade` (no fields)
  - `startRaiseLower` + `deviceIds` + `direction='raise'|'lower'`
  - `stopChanging` + `deviceIds`
  - `setLevelPerMode` + `deviceIds` + `perMode={modeIdOrName: level, ...}` + optional `fadeSeconds`
- **Color** (`capability='color'`, RGBW bulbs):
  - `setColor` + `deviceIds` + `colorName` + optional `level`
  - `toggleColor` + `deviceIds` + `colorName` + optional `level`
  - `setColorPerMode` + `deviceIds` + `perMode={modeIdOrName: {color: 'Red', level: 70}, ...}`
- **Color Temperature** (`capability='colorTemp'`):
  - `setColorTemp` + `deviceIds` + `kelvin` + optional `level`
  - `toggleColorTemp` + `deviceIds` + `kelvin` + optional `level`
  - `fadeColorTemp` + `deviceIds` + `targetKelvin` + `minutes` + `direction='raise'|'lower'`
  - `stopColorTempFade` (no fields)
  - `setColorTempPerMode` + `deviceIds` + `perMode={modeIdOrName: {kelvin: 2700, level: 70}, ...}`
- **Button** (`capability='button'`, pushable-button devices): `push` + `deviceIds` + `buttonNumber`. `pushPerMode` + `deviceIds` + `perMode={modeIdOrName: buttonNumber, ...}`. `choosePerMode` + `buttonNumber` + `perMode={modeIdOrName: [deviceIds], ...}`.
- **Run Custom Action** (`capability='runCommand'`): `command` + `deviceIds` + `capabilityFilter` (default `'Switch'`) + optional `parameters=[{type:'number',value:75},...]` + optional `useLastEventDevice`. Each parameter entry may be a literal (`{type:'number', value:75}`) or variable-sourced (`{type:'number', variable:'myVar'}`); the two forms may be mixed across slots. The `type` field is lowercase (`number`, `decimal`, `string`). Calls any device-driver command (`off`, `on`, `setLevel`, `flashOff`, `refresh`, custom-driver verbs, etc.) on the device list. Use this to call commands not exposed by the higher-level capability mappings.
- **File IO** (`capability='fileWrite'`/`'fileAppend'`/`'fileDelete'`): `fileWrite` + `fileName` + `content` (overwrites). `fileAppend` + `fileName` + `content` (file must exist; `localFile` is an enum picker). `fileDelete` + `fileName`.
- **Z-Wave Polling** (`capability='zwavePoll'`): `action='start'`/`'stop'` + `deviceIds` (Z-Wave switches/dimmers only) + `target='switches'|'dimmers'`.
- **Lock** (`capability='lock'`): `action='lock'`/`'unlock'` + `deviceIds`.
- **HSM** (`capability='hsm'`): `command=armAway/armHome/armNight/disarm/rearm/disarmAll/armRules/cancelAlerts`. No `deviceIds` (**because** HSM is a hub-level service, not device-based). `getSetHSM` appears only when HSM is installed on the hub; there is no `armAll` -- use `armRules`.
- **Thermostat** (`capability='thermostat'`): `action=(any)` + `deviceIds` + optional `mode`/`fanMode`/`heatingSetpoint`/`coolingSetpoint`/`adjustHeating`/`adjustCooling`.
- **Shade/blind** (`capability='shade'`): `open`/`close`/`stop` + `deviceIds`. `setPosition` + `deviceIds` + `position` (0–100).
- **Fan** (`capability='fan'`): `setSpeed` + `deviceIds` + `speed` (low/med/high/auto/etc.). `cycle` + `deviceIds`.
- **Mode** (`capability='mode'`): `action='setMode'` + `modeId` (Integer) or `modeName` (String, case-insensitive). When `modeName` is supplied it is resolved to the numeric mode ID via `location.modes` before the write; an unknown name fails fast with the list of valid mode names. Use `hub_list_modes` to inspect available modes first. Note: `addAction` mode uses the `modeName` field for explicit name-based resolution; `addTrigger` mode uses the generic `state` field instead because triggers cover a superset of device-state events where a single field serves multiple capability types -- `modeName` vs `state` is an intentional surface difference, not a typo.
- **Hub Variable** (`capability='setVariable'`, alias `'variable'`): `variable` (target) + exactly ONE source mode -- `value` (numeric constant), `sourceVariable` (copy from another hub variable), `fromDevice` (`{deviceId, attribute}` -- read a device attribute), or `math` (`{left, op, right}` -- structured variable math). All variable names (`variable`, `sourceVariable`, `math` var-operands) must be existing hub variable names -- unknown names are rejected before any write. The four source modes are mutually exclusive; providing more than one is rejected. `math` binary operators (`+ - * / %`) require `right`; unary operators (`negate absolute round random sqrt sin cos tan asin acos atan log toRadians toDegrees`) reject `right`. A `math` operand that is a number becomes a literal constant; a string operand is a variable name. `fromDevice` reads from any hub device (not just MCP-selected); an attribute not in the device's filtered enum is rejected with `success=false` and the device's available-attribute list. `fromDevice` and `math` require a Number or Decimal target variable -- RM does not offer those source modes for String/Boolean/DateTime targets, so they are rejected with `success=false` before any write. See `addAction setVariable` in `docs/rm_action_subtype_schemas.md` for the full field reference.
- **Logging / Messaging**: `capability='log' + message`. `capability='notification' + deviceIds + message`. `capability='httpGet' + url`. `capability='httpPost' + url + body + optional contentType`. `capability='ping' + ip`.
- **Music/Sound** (`capability='volume'`/`'mute'`/`'chime'`/`'siren'`): `volume + deviceIds + level`. `mute + action='mute'/'unmute' + deviceIds`. `chime + deviceIds + optional playStop/soundNumber`. `siren + deviceIds + optional sirenAction`.
- **Rules** (`capability='privateBoolean'`/`'runRule'`/`'cancelTimers'`/`'pauseRule'`): `privateBoolean + ruleIds + value (Boolean)`. `runRule + ruleIds` (runs actions). `cancelTimers + ruleIds`. `pauseRule + action='pause'/'resume' + ruleIds`. For all four, each `ruleIds` target must resolve to an existing Rule Machine rule -- checked against the live RM rule list before any write -- and a target id that is not an existing rule is rejected fail-loud ("RM is not touched"), steering to `hub_list_rules`, rather than baking a dangling rule reference that renders broken and never fires. On a hub whose rule list can't be resolved (RM not installed or the app-tree read failed) the check is skipped and the write proceeds -- a genuinely dangling id then still bakes broken downstream, matching the conservative transient-skip stance of the device-id guard. A hub with zero rules is NOT a can't-resolve case: every rule target is then rejected fail-loud (none can exist).
- **Activate a Scene / Room Lighting group**: RM 5.1 has no dedicated activate-scene action subtype. Each Scene / Room Lighting instance spawns an activator device that carries the `switch` capability -- activate it via the Switch action: `capability='switch'` + `action='on'` + `deviceIds=[<activatorDeviceId>]` (use `action='off'` to send an off/deactivate command, whose effect is configuration-dependent). Note the discoverability trap: the `activate_scene` action exists ONLY on the legacy custom rule engine (the `hub_*_custom_rule` tools, documented under `hub_get_tool_guide(section='rules')`) -- it is NOT part of this native `addAction` surface.
- **Device control**: `capability='capture' + deviceIds`. `capability='restore'` (no fields). `capability='refresh' + deviceIds`. `capability='poll' + deviceIds`. `capability='disableDevice' + action='disable'/'enable' + deviceIds`.
- **Flow control** (delay/wait/repeat/exit/comment/conditional):
  - `delay` + `hours`/`minutes`/`seconds` + optional `cancelable`/`random` OR `variable=<varName>` (variable-sourced seconds)
  - `delayPerMode` + `perMode={modeIdOrName: {hours, minutes, seconds}, ...}`
  - `cancelDelay`, `exitRule`, `stopRepeat` (no fields)
  - `comment` + `text`
  - `repeat` + `hours`/`minutes`/`seconds` + optional `times` + `stoppable`
  - `repeatWhile` + `expression={conditions:[...], operator?:..., operators?:[...]}` + optional `hours`/`minutes`/`seconds`/`times`/`stoppable`
  - `waitExpression` + `expression={...}` + optional `delay={hours,minutes,seconds}` + `useDuration=true|false`
  - `waitEvents` + `events=[{capability, deviceIds, state, andStays?}, ...]`. Per-event `andStays` is either `true` (wait until the state has held, zero extra duration; an empty map `{}` is equivalent) OR `{hours?, minutes?, seconds?}` to require it hold that long (writes the DASH-indexed `SHours-/SMins-/SSecs-<N>` -- distinct from the trigger's no-dash `SHours<N>`, **because** the doActPage and selectTriggers wizards use different field-name conventions for this slot). A **Mode** event uses `{capability:'Mode', state:<mode name or list of names>}` or `{capability:'Mode', modeIds:[...]}` (`deviceIds` is rejected on a Mode event; the mode is written to RM's mode picker, not `tstate`). **LIMIT**: only ONE `waitEvents` action per rule; RM 5.1 stores wait events in global per-rule settings (not per-action), so a second `waitEvents` action silently overwrites the first. Combine multiple waits into one action's `events` array, or split into chained sub-rules.
  - `ifThen` + `expression={...}` (opens IF block; close with `endIf`)
  - `elseIf` + `expression={...}` (continues IF block; needs preceding `ifThen`)
  - `else` (no fields; needs preceding `ifThen` or `elseIf`)
  - `endIf` (no fields; closes the IF block)

  Per-condition shape for `expression.conditions[]` (same as `addRequiredExpression`): `{capability, deviceIds?, state?, comparator?, value?, compareToVariable?, attribute?, not?, rawSettings?}`. Convenience: pass singular `deviceId: N` (integer) instead of `deviceIds: [N]` (array) -- the dispatcher normalizes before writing. If both `deviceId` and `deviceIds` are supplied, `deviceIds` wins. The same per-capability extended shapes apply -- Mode `modeIds`, Between two times `start`/`end` (`{type:'clock'|'sunrise'|'sunset', time?:'HH:mm', offset?:<minutes>}`; clock `time` is hub-local wall-clock, converted to ISO datetime internally; requires hub `location.timeZone` to be set in Settings > Location and Modes), Variable `variable`+`comparator` (with optional `compareToVariable` for a variable RHS), Custom Attribute `attribute`+`comparator`, compareToDevice Map (`{deviceId, attribute?, offset?}` -- device-relative RHS: the walker toggles `isDev_<N>=true` to reveal the `relDevice_<N>` reference-device picker and writes the optional offset to `state_<N>`; if the offset slot is absent on the firmware, `settingsSkipped` carries `offset_field_not_revealed` and `partial:true`. compareToDevice is mutually exclusive with `state`/`value` and `compareToVariable`). The shared walker `_rmWalkConditionReveal` handles all per-capability reveal sequences for both `ifThen`/`elseIf`/`repeatWhile`/`waitExpression` (doActPage) and `addRequiredExpression` (STPage). `compareToVariable` (variable-vs-variable) IS supported on this row -- the walker toggles `isVar_<N>=true` and discovers the firmware-assigned right-hand variable picker from the live schema; `compareToVariable` and `value`/`state` are mutually exclusive. See the "Extended per-capability spec shapes" section below.

  **Note: nested `subExpression` is REQUIRED-EXPRESSION-ONLY today.** `addAction` (ifThen/elseIf/repeatWhile/waitExpression) rejects nested `subExpression` in `expression.conditions[]` with a targeted error (`"nested subExpression on this row is not yet supported"`) -- flatten the conditions list or move the nested expression to a Required Expression. `addRequiredExpression` supports nesting today.

  Note: some sensor capabilities (Water sensor, Smoke detector, Carbon monoxide detector, Tamper alert, Acceleration) report discrete events -- use capability-specific state names (e.g. `'wet'`/`'dry'`, `'detected'`/`'clear'`, `'active'`/`'inactive'`) rather than numeric comparator conditions. Carbon dioxide sensor is intentionally EXCLUDED here: `CarbonDioxideMeasurement` is numeric ppm (comparator + value), not a discrete enum.

##### `addRequiredExpression` STPage capability list

RM 5.1 Required Expression conditions accept these `capability` values (per-condition):

- **Device-state**: `Switch`, `Motion`, `Contact`, `Lock`, `Presence`, `Smoke detector`, `Water sensor`, `Tamper alert`, `Acceleration`, `Carbon monoxide detector`, `Carbon dioxide sensor`, `Power source`, `Window Shade`
- **Numeric**: `Battery`, `Dimmer`, `Energy meter`, `Fan Speed`, `Humidity`, `Illuminance`, `Power meter`, `Temperature`, `Thermostat cool setpoint`, `Thermostat fan mode`, `Thermostat heat setpoint`, `Thermostat mode`, `Thermostat state`
- **Time-based**: `Days of week`, `Between two dates`, `Between two times`, `On a Day`
- **Hub state**: `Mode`, `Private Boolean`
- **Variable comparison**: `Variable`
- **Custom / other**: `Custom Attribute`, `Last Event Device` (not a condition -- see note below), `Lock codes` (not authorable here -- see note below)

Note: `Last Event Device` appears in the STPage condition picker but is not usable as a condition -- it references the device that fired the rule's trigger (an action-side reference, used in actions such as running a command on the triggering device), not a testable state, and it is not a trigger capability either. It is rejected fail-loud on every structured condition surface (`addRequiredExpression`, `addTrigger.condition`, and the `addAction` expression subtypes); remove it from the expression. `Lock codes` likewise appears in the STPage condition picker but cannot be authored through the structured condition path -- a Lock codes condition needs a lock device plus a specific code name and the tool has no field for either, so it is rejected fail-loud with a pointer to the Rule Machine UI; author it there or use a different testable capability.

Note: `Private Boolean` is only valid in Required Expressions -- it does NOT appear in the IF-expression capability list used by `ifThen`/`elseIf`/`repeatWhile`/`waitExpression`.

Note: some sensor capabilities (Water sensor, Smoke detector, Carbon monoxide detector, Tamper alert, Acceleration) report discrete events rather than a continuous enum state. Pass `state: 'wet'` / `state: 'dry'` for Water sensor, `state: 'detected'` / `state: 'clear'` for detector types, `state: 'active'` / `state: 'inactive'` for Acceleration -- NOT a comparator-based numeric condition. Carbon dioxide sensor is intentionally EXCLUDED: `CarbonDioxideMeasurement` is numeric ppm (use comparator + value), not a discrete enum; the names look superficially symmetric to Carbon monoxide detector but RM 5.1 treats them differently. See `docs/rm_action_subtype_schemas.md` for the full state-value table.

##### `replaceRequiredExpression` -- change an existing Required Expression in place

`addRequiredExpression` refuses (success:false, `requiredExpressionAlreadyExists:true`) when the rule already has a committed Required Expression. To CHANGE the existing expression, use `replaceRequiredExpression` -- same `appId`, no clone. The spec shape is IDENTICAL to `addRequiredExpression` (`{conditions:[...], operator|operators}`, with the same per-condition fields and every extended per-capability shape including nested `subExpression`), so the replacement can be single-condition, multi-condition, or nested.

Mechanism (full-formula replace, matching `addRequiredExpression`'s whole-expression semantics): the tool deletes the whole committed expression (clicks `cancelST`, "Delete Required Expression"), then builds the new condition(s) by delegating to the same validated `addRequiredExpression` walker -- which navigates fresh from `mainPage`, sets `useST`, reaches the `cond` new-condition selector, walks the condition(s), seals via `hasRule`/`doneST`, submits the sub-page Done back-nav -- and fires `updateRule`.

- **Precondition.** A committed Required Expression MUST already exist. If none does, `replaceRequiredExpression` returns `success:false, requiredExpressionMissing:true` with an error steering you to `addRequiredExpression` -- it never silently turns a replace into an add.
- **Destructive-window contract (the key safety property).** The `cancelST` delete is immediately destructive -- the committed gate is gone the instant it is clicked. Two invariants protect your data: (1) the ENTIRE new-conditions spec is validated BEFORE the click (conditions/operator/operators rules, deviceId existence), so a malformed spec fails with the OLD expression still intact (no delete); (2) after the delete succeeds, ANY failure auto-restores the pre-op backup the tool took. The covered window extends through the TRAILING finalize: the rebuild, the trailing `updateRule` click, AND the post-commit health check are all inside it, so a post-commit health flip (the rebuild baked but left the rule unhealthy, e.g. a ghost-`ifThen` clear wrapped it in `IF(**Broken Condition**)`) OR a rejected trailing `updateRule` also triggers the restore -- not just a rebuild that fails to bake or a post-delete re-read failure. The result then carries `requiredExpressionReplaced:false` plus one of three honest restore outcomes: `requiredExpressionRestored:true` ("the replace failed during the rebuild; the original Required Expression was restored from backup <key>"); OR `requiredExpressionRestored:false` when the original expression could NOT be put back in place -- no pre-op backup was available, the backup replay returned a partial failure, the replay could not be confirmed back on STPage (the rule may be left UNGATED), or the restore itself threw ("the original Required Expression was DELETED and auto-restore did not complete -- manually restore via `hub_restore_backup(backupKey=<key>)`"); OR `requiredExpressionRestored:false` plus `requiredExpressionRestoredAs:<newId>` when the auto-restore could not reuse the original `appId` and recreated the rule under a NEW id (the original `appId` is now a dead husk -- use the new id and delete the husk via `hub_delete_native_app(appId=<original>)`). A post-delete failure is NEVER reported as a benign no-op.
- **Fail-loud delete.** If the `cancelST` delete is silently rejected (STPage still shows the committed-expression controls afterward), the tool auto-restores the pre-op backup and returns `success:false` naming the step; the existing expression is preserved. Inspect via `hub_get_app_config(appId)`.
- **Success envelope.** On a clean success (the rebuild baked, the trailing `updateRule` fired, and the post-commit health check passed) the response carries `requiredExpressionReplaced:true` (a NEW expression was COMMITTED, not merely the old one deleted) plus the same `conditionIndices` / `settingsApplied` / `settingsSkipped` / `partial` / `repairHints` envelope as `addRequiredExpression`. Unlike `addRequiredExpression`, the replace path does NOT leave a committed-but-not-live result on a trailing-`updateRule` failure: because the delete already happened, a rejected `updateRule` (or a post-commit health flip) is treated as a post-delete failure and AUTO-RESTORES the pre-op backup (see the destructive-window contract above) -- so on that path you get `success:false` + `requiredExpressionReplaced:false` + `requiredExpressionRestored:*`, with the trailing-updateRule slots (`updateRuleFailed` / `expressionNotLive` / `updateRuleError`) still populated so you can see WHY the finalize failed.
- **Deleted-condition residue.** The replaced condition's underlying settings (e.g. `rCapab_<N>` / `rDev_<N>` / `state_<N>` / `modes<N>`) linger in the settings pool but are NOT part of the active formula -- this is harmless and renders cleanly (a config/STPage read surfaces only active-formula slots, so the orphans do not even appear); no extra cleanup write is issued. The new condition slot indices may continue past the deleted slot (allocation does not reuse the deleted index).
- **Committed-RE detection.** A committed Required Expression is detected by the `cancelST` + `editST` control pair on STPage (the no-RE state offers neither, and the condition-building state is ruled out separately). This is intentionally a two-field tell, narrower than `addRequiredExpression`'s three-field check, because the `cancelST`/`editST` pair is the firmware-stable marker on RM 5.1.8 whereas the third field (`stopOnST`) varies across revisions.

`replaceRequiredExpression` is also a valid `patches[]` op (reported as `op: 'replaceRequiredExpression'`). Inside a `patches[]` batch its auto-restore is scoped to a per-op snapshot taken just before the op, so a failed replace op does NOT revert earlier successful ops in the same batch.

##### Extended per-capability spec shapes

Applies to `addRequiredExpression.conditions[]` (STPage) and `addAction.expression.conditions[]` (doActPage); the shared walker `_rmWalkConditionReveal` handles every per-capability reveal sequence below. For `addTrigger.condition`, see the narrowed support list in the "Inline conditional trigger" entry above -- Mode-via-picker / Between two times / compareToDevice are NOT yet available on the trigger row.

**Mode**: `{capability:'Mode', state:'Night'}` or `{capability:'Mode', modeIds:['3']}`.
  The walker resolves mode names to IDs via `location.modes` and writes the firmware-assigned `modes<N>` picker (e.g. `modes1`) discovered from the live schema (not hardcoded). Note: triggers use `modesX<N>`; STPage/doActPage conditions use `modes<N>` (no `X` prefix).

**Between two times**: `{capability:'Between two times', start:{type:'clock'|'sunrise'|'sunset', time?:'HH:mm', offset?:<minutes>}, end:{...same shape}}`.
  `time` is required when `type='clock'` (walker converts `HH:mm` to ISO datetime with hub-local TZ offset internally); `offset` is required when `type='sunrise'` or `'sunset'`. User-supplied `HH:mm` is interpreted as hub-local wall-clock time; the walker constructs ISO datetime with the anchor-date timezone offset internally so DST shifts between now and the January anchor do not affect rendering. Firmware fields: `starting<N>` (type enum), `startingA<N>` (clock time), `ending<N>`, `endingA<N>`/`endSunriseOffset<N>`. Precondition: hub timezone must be configured (Settings > Location and Modes). If `location.timeZone` is null, the walker throws before touching the wizard -- set hub timezone first.

**Variable comparison**: `{capability:'Variable', variable:'<hubVarName>', comparator:'=', value:<v>}` (constant RHS) or `{...comparator:'=', compareToVariable:'<otherHubVarName>'}` (variable RHS). A Boolean variable has no comparator field: pass `value:true|false` (optionally `comparator:'='`, negate with `not:true`); any other comparator, a `compareToVariable`, or a value other than true/false is rejected before the Boolean value is written. The capability and variable pickers are already written by then, so the rejection cancels the in-flight condition. A page that also shows a comparator field is treated as a comparison, not a Boolean.
  A free-valued (String) variable (and a free-valued Custom Attribute) also accepts the STRING comparator `*contains*` (substring match, written verbatim -- keep the asterisks; the substring is the `value`). There is no "does not contain": express negation with `not:true` + `*contains*`. A numeric variable uses `=`/`<`/`>`/etc. instead.
  Writes the firmware-assigned variable-name picker discovered from the live schema. Fail-loud if the variable name is not in the revealed enum AND the schema option list is non-empty. When the schema option list is empty (firmware lazily-populates the enum, or probe-timing race), the walker logs warn + pushes a `variable-validation` / `api_unavailable` sentinel to `settingsSkipped` and proceeds with the write unvalidated (`partial:true`). For `compareToVariable` the walker toggles `isVar_<N>=true` and discovers the right-hand picker rather than hardcoding `xVarR_<N>` -- **because** `selectTriggers` consistently exposes `xVarR` but the walker pages (STPage/doActPage) can expose a differently-suffixed field, so the walker resolves whatever the live schema reveals; an empty RHS option list degrades with a `compareToVariable-validation` / `api_unavailable` sentinel (`partial:true`). For value-comparison comparators `value` and `compareToVariable` are mutually exclusive (passing both is rejected); state-change comparators (`*changed*`/`*became*`) take no RHS.

**Device-relative comparison**: `{capability:'Temperature', deviceIds:[N], comparator:'>', compareToDevice:{deviceId:M, attribute?:'temperature', offset?:-2}}`.
  Compares a device's attribute to another device's reading on the SAME capability, optionally offset by a decimal amount, rather than a literal threshold (e.g. "Temperature of devN is > devM minus 2.0"). The walker writes the comparator `RelrDev_<N>`, toggles `isDev_<N>=true` ("Relative to a device?") to reveal the SINGLE reference-device picker `relDevice_<N>`, writes the reference device id, then writes the optional offset to `state_<N>` (omit -> offset 0). `relDevice_<N>` is a capability.* device picker locked to the LHS capability; on normal firmware RM populates its dropdown client-side, so the configPage schema exposes no options and an empty option list is the normal case (does NOT flag `partial`). The reference `deviceId` is existence-validated hub-wide before any write (the same `/device/fullJson` check the LHS `deviceIds` get); a nonexistent id is rejected up front. On a rare firmware variant that DOES surface device-picker options, the walker additionally defensively rejects a reference id absent from that list. Capability-mismatch (a reference device lacking the LHS capability) otherwise surfaces in the rendered/broken state. compareToDevice is rejected with a literal RHS (`state`/`value`) or a `compareToVariable` RHS -- mutually exclusive; supply exactly one RHS shape. Passing compareToDevice on a non-numeric capability (Mode / Between two times / Variable / Custom Attribute) is rejected up front with a fail-loud error naming the capability -- it is NOT silently dropped. There is NO separate reference-attribute picker: the compared attribute is implied by the shared capability, so `compareToDevice.attribute` is OPTIONAL and informational (no wire consumer; neither validated nor written). Fail-loud if the comparator is omitted or if `relDevice_<N>` does not reveal after `isDev_<N>=true`. If the offset field (`state_<N>`) is absent it drops the offset with an `offset_field_not_revealed` sentinel (`partial:true`). **Intentional isDev/isVar asymmetry (do not "fix"):** an EMPTY option list is NORMAL for `compareToDevice`'s `relDevice_<N>` BECAUSE it is a capability.* DEVICE picker (RM fills it client-side) -- no options, no sentinel, no partial. This deliberately differs from `compareToVariable`, whose right-hand picker is an ENUM picker where an empty option list IS an anomaly and emits an `api_unavailable` sentinel with `partial:true`. The divergence reflects picker type (device vs enum), not an oversight.

**Sub-expressions (parens) -- addRequiredExpression-only**: for nested expressions like `P1 AND (P2 OR P3)`, a condition entry can also be `{subExpression: {conditions: [<inner conds>], operator?: 'AND'|'OR'|'XOR', operators?: [...]}}`. The STPage walker recursively handles nested sub-expressions of arbitrary depth. `addAction` (`ifThen`/`elseIf`/`repeatWhile`/`waitExpression`) does **NOT** support `subExpression` on this row -- the doActPage walker rejects it with `"nested subExpression on this row is not yet supported"`. Flatten the conditions list or move the nested expression into a Required Expression.

##### Partial-success and trailing-updateRule response slots

`addRequiredExpression`, `addTrigger`, and `addAction` all return rich envelopes. Beyond `success`/`partial`/`settingsSkipped`/`repairHints`, the following slots help callers diagnose without log-grep:

- `settingsSkipped[]` sentinel reasons callers may see:
  - `offset_field_not_revealed` -- compareToDevice optional offset field (`state_<N>`) absent after the reference-device write. Entry carries the requested `offset` value for reference; the offset is dropped but the device-relative comparison is otherwise complete. Flips `partial:true`.
  - `api_unavailable` paired with `key: "variable-validation"` (LHS variable picker) OR `key: "compareToVariable-validation"` (RHS variable picker for `compareToVariable`) -- the ENUM picker returned an empty option list, so schema-side validation could not run. The write still PROCEEDS best-effort with the caller-supplied value (success stays true; retry is NOT needed) and `partial:true` flags only that validation was skipped. NOTE (intentional isDev/isVar asymmetry -- do not "fix"): `compareToDevice` does NOT emit this. Its `relDevice_<N>` reference picker is a capability.* DEVICE picker, which exposes no options client-side -- an empty option list is normal there and is NOT a validation gap (no sentinel, no `partial`). This deliberately differs from `compareToVariable`'s ENUM picker, where an empty option list IS an anomaly. The divergence reflects picker type (device vs enum), not an oversight. A wrong-capability reference device surfaces in the rendered/broken state, not a pre-write check.
  - `reveal_fallback_to_existing_field` -- the walker matched an already-visible field instead of a newly-revealed one (static-schema firmware path). **Informational** -- does NOT flip `partial` by itself.
  - `useST_idempotent_noop` -- the idempotent `useST=true` mainPage toggle (Step 1 of `addRequiredExpression`) was already set, so the write did not advance the schema. Cosmetic, not a lost value. **Informational** -- does NOT flip `partial` by itself.
  - `device_list_committed_schema_unchanged` -- an action's device-picker field (`shadeOpenClose.<N>` / `onOffSwitch.<N>` / `lockLockUnlock.<N>` / `fanRL.<N>` / ...) was the LAST write of the action and revealed no further schema, so the write could not be seen to "advance" and was initially tagged `silent_rejection` -- but the requested device IDs DID commit (value-echo-gated against `statusJson`, entry carries `committedDeviceIds`). Cosmetic on `addAction` only (**because** on the trigger/condition paths the device picker always reveals a subsequent schema field, so that path never produces the cosmetic silent_rejection this reclassifies). **Informational** -- does NOT flip `partial` by itself. A genuine device-write FAILURE (IDs absent from the echo) keeps `silent_rejection` and still flips `partial`.
  - `comparator_force_written_unverified` -- on a Custom Attribute add, the exposure-probe re-fetch (issued after writing the attribute to decide whether the comparator field is still exposed) failed transiently. The comparator was force-written straight to the page as a fallback so the value is not silently dropped, but the write could not be schema-confirmed. The add does NOT abort (`success` stays true; the field is in `settingsApplied`), but this flips `partial:true` so callers know to verify via `hub_get_app_config`.
  - `comparator_force_write_failed` -- the force-write fallback above ALSO failed (the hub rejected the POST, e.g. a stale version token). The comparator did not land. The add still does NOT abort -- the rest of the trigger/condition committed -- but this is genuine degradation and flips `partial:true`. Re-add the comparator via `hub_set_rule(walkStep=...)` or rebuild the row.
  - `comparator_not_representable_for_enum_attribute` -- a state-change comparator (`*changed*` / the `*became*` family, which carry no right-hand value) was requested on a Custom Attribute the hub recognizes as an ENUM (switch/motion/contact/lock/...). For such an attribute RM exposes only the value picker (e.g. on/off) and no comparator slot, so a no-RHS change comparator has nowhere to land and cannot be represented through this path. The rest of the trigger/condition still commits, but the comparator is genuinely dropped, so this flips `partial:true` and adds a repair hint. To express "this attribute changed", trigger on the device's native capability instead (e.g. `capability:'Switch'`), or use a non-built-in attribute name (which RM treats as free-valued and exposes a real comparator). This applies across all four wizard surfaces (trigger row, conditional-trigger condition, STPage, doActPage). If the value picker DOES happen to offer a change-equivalent option, the helper routes it there instead and no skip is produced.
  - `change_comparator_not_representable_for_device_state` -- the device-state sibling of the entry above, on an `addTrigger` device-state capability (Switch/Motion/Contact/Lock/Water/Smoke/...). This skip is trigger-only **because** a device-state change comparator has no meaning on a condition (conditions are point-in-time, so `addTrigger.condition` / `addRequiredExpression` / `ifThen` reject a change comparator on a device-state capability outright rather than degrading). A device-state capability has no comparator field; its `tstate<N>` value picker carries both the state enum and any change option. When a no-RHS state-change comparator (`*changed*`/`*became*`) is requested but the live value picker offers no matching change option, the change token cannot land and is reported here (rather than being written to the absent `ReltDev<N>`, which would render the trigger "turns null"). Flips `partial:true`; the skip carries the picker's `pickerOptions` and a `hint` to write `tstate<N>` directly via a `walkStep` call. Routing is decided by the LIVE rendered field, so it covers every device-state capability -- not only the ones the discover schema enumerates.
  - `state_change_comparator_ignored_explicit_value` -- **Informational** (does NOT flip `partial`). A no-RHS state-change comparator was requested ALONGSIDE an explicit `state`/`value` (a contradictory spec). It fires on a device-state or enum Custom Attribute trigger AND on an enum Custom Attribute condition across the condition surfaces (the conditional-trigger condition wizard, STPage, and doActPage). The explicit value wins into the value picker and the row works as an equals-check, so the dropped change intent is reported informationally. Keyed on a synthetic non-field key (`comparator@tstate<N>` on the device-state trigger path; the hidden `ReltDev<N>` on the Custom Attribute trigger path; the hidden `RelrDev_<N>` on the Custom Attribute condition surfaces) **because** the real value-picker field is already listed in `settingsApplied` (the explicit value committed), and repeating it in `settingsSkipped` would double-list it and violate the applied/skipped-disjoint invariant.
  - `state_change_route_unverified_fetch_failed` -- the post-device-write `selectTriggers` re-fetch (needed to inspect which field the wizard renders before placing a state-change comparator) failed transiently, so the change token could not be verifiably placed. This applies only to a non-numeric (device-state/unknown) family; a numeric capability instead force-writes its `ReltDev<N>` comparator best-effort (`comparator_force_written_unverified`) since `*changed*` is a real option there. Rather than aborting or force-writing a possibly-wrong value, the device-state add degrades to `partial:true` with a `hint` to verify via `hub_get_app_config` and, if needed, write `tstate<N>` (device-state) or `ReltDev<N>` (numeric) via a `walkStep` call. Because the re-fetch failed, the real target field is unknown, so this skip keys on the synthetic `comparator@tstate<N>` -- the repair target lives in the `hint`, not the key.
  - `not_in_schema` -- a written field was absent from the current page schema, so the value did not land. This IS genuine degradation and flips `partial` on `addTrigger`, the condition wizard, AND the walker pages STPage/doActPage: a field the helper tried to write but the live schema never exposed means the value was lost. Note that a state-change comparator such as `*changed*` is itself written as a VALUE into the comparator field (e.g. `ReltDev_<N>`), not an absent RHS, so a clean `*changed*` trigger on a free-valued attribute (where the comparator field IS exposed) produces NO `not_in_schema` skip on its comparator -- if one appears on a real field, the value genuinely failed to write and the partial flag is real. (When `*changed*` is requested on an ENUM-recognized attribute -- where RM exposes no comparator slot at all -- the comparator is reported via the dedicated `comparator_not_representable_for_enum_attribute` skip above, not `not_in_schema`.) Two non-degrading exemptions do NOT flip `partial`:
    - The cosmetic `isCondTrig.<N>` finalize toggle on `addTrigger`: after a non-conditional trigger commits, the helper writes `isCondTrig.<N>=false` best-effort to dismiss the residual "Conditional Trigger?" prompt RM only sometimes exposes; when the prompt already closed the field is gone and that skip is exempt.
    - The enum-recognized **Custom Attribute** comparator across all FOUR wizard surfaces: the trigger row (`ReltDev<N>`), the conditional-trigger condition wizard (`RelrDev_<N>`), the STPage walker, and the doActPage walker. When the hub treats the chosen attribute as an ENUM (switch, motion, contact, lock, ...), picking it re-renders the page to reveal the enum value picker (`tstate<N>` / `state_<N>`) and HIDE the comparator field. The helper detects the value picker is exposed and deliberately does NOT write a VALUE comparator (`=`/`<`/etc.) -- so NO skip is produced for that case (it is exempt by construction, not by exempting a produced skip) and `partial` stays false; the requested value lands in the picker. The ONE exception is a no-RHS state-change comparator (`*changed*` / `*became*`): there is no comparator slot to hold it AND no value to put in the picker, so unless the picker itself offers a change-equivalent option the comparator is genuinely unrepresentable and the helper emits a `comparator_not_representable_for_enum_attribute` skip (flips `partial`, see above) rather than reporting a false clean success. A free-valued Custom Attribute still reveals the comparator and writes it normally. The walker handles the *neither-field-rendered* edge case asymmetrically between its two Custom Attribute sites: the dedicated capability-block (Site A) THROWS because its reveal-step contract has no field to write into without a revealed target, whereas the default enum/numeric block (Site B) still attempts the write because its `writeST` POSTs-then-verifies (no schema-containment pre-gate) -- on a hidden field the post-write verify records a `silent_rejection` skip that flips `partial`, surfacing the degradation without hard-failing the wizard. On the trigger row and condition wizard the analogous neither-rendered write goes through `_rmWriteSettingOnPage`, which DOES schema-gate, so the comparator is not POSTed and a `not_in_schema` skip flips `partial` instead. On a TRANSIENT exposure-probe re-fetch failure (empty/unparseable response after the attribute write), all four surfaces degrade gracefully rather than aborting: the comparator is force-written best-effort and a `comparator_force_written_unverified` skip flips `partial` (verify via `hub_get_app_config`).
- Trailing-updateRule failure slots:
  - `addRequiredExpression`: `updateRuleFailed: true` + `expressionNotLive: true` + `updateRuleError: <message>` when the post-commit `updateRule` click is rejected. `success` flips false and `partial` flips true; the expression IS committed but not live (`repairHints` adds a recovery line pointing at `hub_set_rule(button='updateRule', confirm=true)` -- re-fire to make it live, no restore needed since nothing was deleted).
  - `replaceRequiredExpression`: a rejected trailing `updateRule` is handled DIFFERENTLY from `addRequiredExpression`. Because the replace already deleted the old expression, a rejected `updateRule` is a post-delete failure: it AUTO-RESTORES the pre-op backup, so the result is `success:false` + `requiredExpressionReplaced:false` + `requiredExpressionRestored:*` (NOT a committed-but-not-live result), with `updateRuleFailed: true` + `expressionNotLive: true` + `updateRuleError: <message>` still set so you can see why the finalize failed. On a clean replace it returns `requiredExpressionReplaced:true`; when there is no committed expression to replace it returns `requiredExpressionMissing:true` (success:false). See the destructive-window contract above for the full restore-outcome set.
  - `addTrigger`: `updateRuleFailed: true` + `subscriptionsNotLive: true` + `updateRuleError: <message>` with the same `success`/`partial` flip. The trigger row IS in the rule's appSettings but the running rule instance never re-subscribed to the device events -- retry `updateRule` to populate subscriptions.
  - `addLocalVariable`: `updateRuleFailed: true` + `variableNotLive: true` + `updateRuleError: <message>` with the same `success`/`partial` flip. The variable IS created on the hub but the rule's action map never re-evaluates against the new variable until updateRule fires -- retry as above.
  - `addTriggers` / `addActions` (bulk path): `updateRuleFailed: true` + `subscriptionsNotLive: true` + `updateRuleError: <message>` with the same `success`/`partial` flip. The per-item adds are committed (triggers/actions arrays still surface on the success-shape keys) but the running rule instance never re-subscribed -- retry as above. This applies only when finalisation was attempted and rejected.
  - Bulk early stop (`addTriggers` / `addActions`, create, `replaceActions`, and `patches` including each op's inner list): the first item or op that returns `success:false` or `partial:true` stops the request. Items after the stopping item return `notAttempted:true`, the remaining `updateRule` and Done are not fired, and the result carries `bulkStoppedAfter`, `finalisationNotAttempted:true` and an `error` naming the stopping item. On create, a Required Expression whose re-init `updateRule` was rejected also stops the request, so `bulkStoppedAfter:'requiredExpression'` can arrive together with `updateRuleFailed` + `updateRuleError`. Skipping finalisation is not a rollback: items before the stop remain written, actions self-bake, `replaceActions` has already cleared the old list, and create may already have finalised its trigger and Required Expression sections, so earlier writes can already affect an active rule. On an edit, repair the failed item and add the not-attempted items, or restore `backup.backupKey`; a newly created rule has no pre-operation backup, so repair it or delete and re-create it. Fire `updateRule` once the rule is complete.
  - `patches`: `updateRuleFailed: true` + `patchesNotLive: true` + `updateRuleError: <message>` with the same `success`/`partial` flip. The patch ops landed but the rule will not re-evaluate / re-subscribe until updateRule fires -- retry as above. This applies only when finalisation was attempted and rejected.
  - `removeTrigger` / `modifyTrigger` / `modifyAction` / `removeAction` / `clearActions` / `replaceActions` / `moveAction`: `updateRuleFailed: true` + `subscriptionsNotLive: true` + `updateRuleError: <message>` with the same `success`/`partial` flip. The mutation IS committed but the rule never re-subscribed -- retry as above.
  - `walkStep` `operation:'drive'` outcomes: A finished drive fails when a step fails (the top-level `error` and `repairHints` name it) or when the rule ends with a structural issue the drive introduced, listed in `structuralIssues` (for example a block it opened and never closed: add the closer, or restore). Structural issues that were already present before the drive are listed in `preExistingStructuralIssues` and do not fail it, so building inside an already-open block across calls is allowed. That exemption needs a structural baseline read before the first step; if the read fails, pre-existing issues cannot be told apart from new ones and fail the drive, and the result carries `baselineUnavailable` with the reason, so compare with `hub_get_rule_health` before re-running. `healthUnverified:true` (with `success:false` and `partial:true`) marks a finished drive with at least one mutating step whose final health check the time budget skipped: its steps are committed, so check `hub_get_rule_health` rather than re-running the drive. A drive the budget pauses between steps instead returns `status:'in_progress'` with `stepsRemaining`.

A standalone mutating `walkStep` (`write`, `click`, `navigate`, or `done`) whose time budget skips the health probe also returns `success:false`, `partial:true`, and `healthUnverified:true` when the operation otherwise succeeded. This is a terminal request with committed work, not a checkpoint to replay: call `hub_get_rule_health(appId=...)` and address any issue before continuing or treating the rule as complete. Read-only `introspect` and the deliberately deferred per-step health inside an unfinished drive do not acquire that failure flag. Modern detached writes discard the request clock and check health normally; the budget case primarily affects legacy requests. An unreadable probe remains separately identified by `health.unreadable` and its verification hint.

**Naming-divergence rationale.** The `*NotLive` slot name encodes the **consequence** of the trailing-updateRule failure, not the operation that committed. Each tool surfaces the consequence that matters most to a caller deciding how to recover:

- `expressionNotLive` (addRequiredExpression): the rule's gate evaluator never re-picked-up the new expression -- the gate stays at its prior state until updateRule fires. The recovery path is the same retry, but the diagnostic story callers tell themselves is "my new gate isn't being evaluated yet."
- `subscriptionsNotLive` (addTrigger, bulk addTriggers/addActions, action-mutation, trigger-mutation): the running rule instance never re-subscribed to the device events its trigger depends on -- the rule will not fire on those events until updateRule fires. Diagnostic story: "my new/changed trigger doesn't get the event."
- `variableNotLive` (addLocalVariable): the variable IS created on the hub but the rule's action map never re-evaluates against the new variable until updateRule fires. Diagnostic story: "my actions can't read this variable yet."
- `patchesNotLive` (patches): the patch ops landed but the rule won't re-evaluate / re-subscribe (catch-all because patches can bundle any mix of the above). Diagnostic story: "I just patched a bunch of stuff and nothing is taking effect."

All four share `updateRuleFailed` and `updateRuleError` for the common facts. The slot-name divergence is intentional -- a caller-facing diagnostic, not a code-side typology. Single-name unification was considered and rejected because it would force every caller to read the operation-type to interpret the consequence.

##### `clearActions` / `replaceActions` commit semantics + rare defensive partial

Arg shapes: `clearActions: true` (boolean, no index -- removes every action). `replaceActions: [<spec>, ...]` (array; each entry takes the same shape as an `addAction` item). `replaceActions: []` clears all actions without adding any -- equivalent to `clearActions: true`.

`clearActions` / `replaceActions` commit the trashActs delete **synchronously**: the tool submits the full selectActions page form (the complete form-action envelope plus the serialized page state, exactly as the native UI does), which makes Rule Machine run its `trashActs` submitOnChange handler in-band during the POST. The selected actions are deleted by the time the call returns, so the common-case response is a normal success with the actions gone.

A bare settings-write of `trashActs` (the prior approach) stored the value but never ran the handler, so the delete could strand. The full-form submit fixes that root cause.

The tool keeps a thin defensive net: it still verifies the delete via a short retry loop after the submit. In the rare residual case where verification keeps seeing the actions present (a stuck `state.editAct` no-op, or an uncommon firmware commit lag), the tool returns the eventual-consistency partial below rather than a hard failure. This should almost never fire now that the handler runs synchronously:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "partial": true,
  "asyncCommitLikely": true,
  "appId": "<id>",
  "stage": "clearActions.verify_absent",
  "httpWriteStatus": 200,
  "actionsRequestedForRemoval": [1, 2],
  "actionsStillPresent": [1, 2],
  "possibleStateEditAct": false,
  "wizardStuck": false,
  "error": "<existing diagnostic message>",
  "safeRecovery": {
    "recommended": "verify-then-decide",
    "verifyVia": "hub_get_app_config(appId: <id>)",
    "ifActionsAbsent": "treat as success -- clearActions committed post-response",
    "ifActionsPresent": "wait 15s, then call hub_get_app_config to re-check. If actions still present, retry clearActions, or clear state.editAct via hub_set_rule(button='cancelAct', pageName='doActPage', confirm=true) first.",
    "avoid": ["cancelTrash"]
  },
  "backup": "<backup>",
  "restoreHint": "<restoreHint>",
  "verifyHint": "<verifyHint>"
}
```

The caller's recovery path is to call `hub_get_app_config(appId)` and inspect the actions list. If absent, treat the operation as a success -- the delete committed between the POST return and this verify fetch. If still present, retry. **Do not** invoke `cancelTrash` to recover -- in trash-confirmation mode it can commit pending deletes rather than abort.

For `replaceActions`, this same retry-window-expired case on the inner clearActions step yields `stage: 'replaceActions.clear_committed_late_no_add'`. The add half is **not attempted** -- because the clear may have committed asynchronously, completing the add would risk a double-write if the caller retries the whole replace after seeing the partial. The original action specs are echoed back as `pendingActionsToAdd` so the caller can finish the replace via `addAction` (or bulk `addActions`) once `hub_get_app_config` confirms the clear committed. `clearActionsResult` exposes a fingerprint subset of the standalone clearActions partial: `{stage, asyncCommitLikely, actionsRequestedForRemoval, actionsStillPresent, error}` -- the outer envelope carries the `safeRecovery` / `backup` / `restoreHint` / `verifyHint` slots. On the replaceActions sub-shape, `verifyHint` AND `error` are replaced with copy that names the data-loss-protection rationale rather than echoing clearActions' diagnostic.

`removeAction`, `removeTrigger`, and `modifyTrigger` remain on the legacy flat error shape (no `asyncCommitLikely` envelope) **because** each operates on a single row and there is no add half, so the data-loss case (add-half double-write on retry) that justifies the richer recovery contract does not apply. `modifyAction` is the exception that proves the rule: it DOES have an add half (delete + re-add + reposition), so it carries the richer contract instead -- post-rebuild readback gates `success` (target list AND the rebuilt verb/value fields), reposition soft-failures surface as `moveSoftFail` + `verifyHint` (the inner `asyncCommitLikely` rides `moveResults[]`), a mid-composite budget pause returns `budgetPaused` + `movesRemaining` with explicit finish-up steps, and a throw from the re-add or reposition legs reports that the rule IS modified with the restore path -- never the pre-flight nothing-to-restore hint. (The delete leg's own mid-flight throw is outside that wrapper: its retry-exhaustion message states the action is still present, which the helper verifies before throwing.) When the trailing updateRule is skipped -- re-add failure or budget pause -- `subscriptionsNotLive` is TRUE: the delete committed without a re-init.

When `clearActions` / `replaceActions` appears inside a `patches` sub-spec and hits the retry-window-expired case, the raw `[asyncCommitLikely]` marker is stripped from the per-patch error **but** the structured envelope is NOT emitted -- because the failed op stops the batch and the per-patch `success: false`, the outer `partial:` flag and `bulkStoppedAfter` already surface the failure, the caller instead receives a flat `{success: false, op: '...', error: '...', spec: ...}` entry in `patches[i]` and should match on the "after 10s of retries" phrase to identify the eventual-consistency case.

Implication: when a `patches` sub-spec containing `clearActions` / `replaceActions` hits the async-commit case, the batch stops there. Later ops return `notAttempted:true` and the trailing `updateRule` is not fired, but ops before it stay written. For clear-then-add in one call, use top-level `replaceActions` (which skips the add half on async-commit) rather than chaining patches.

Degenerate-case semantics: `actionsRequestedForRemoval: null` indicates the pre-write snapshot fetch failed; `actionsStillPresent: null` indicates the post-window re-fetch failed; `possibleStateEditAct: false` is the safe default when `_rmGetStateEditAct` fails. These three are best-effort diagnostic slots -- `null` does NOT mean "field absent," it means "fetch failed on this side; the structured envelope is still actionable via the other fields and `safeRecovery`."

#### `hub_set_rule` create reference

##### appType options

`appType` selects which class of native app to create. NOTE: this selector belongs to `hub_set_native_app` — `hub_set_rule` always creates `rule_machine` rules (default: `rule_machine`):

- `rule_machine` — Rule Machine 5.1. Creates an RM 5.1 rule specifically; RM 5.0 is not selectable.
- `button_controller` — Button Controller-5.1 instance. (Create button RULES under it with `buttonRule`, not `appType`.)
- `groups_scenes` — Group-2.1. `notifier` — Notifier. (Visual Rules are NOT an `appType` here — create them with `hub_set_visual_rule`; `hub_set_native_app` only edits/deletes them by `appId`.)
- `basic_rule` — Basic Rule-1.0. A classic dynamicPage app (generic `createchild` works); edits are clean because its `commitButton` is null (submitOnChange, no `updateRule` button).
- Button Rules are NOT an `appType` — they're grandchildren of a Button Controller; use the `buttonRule` param. Other classic SmartApps (Room Lighting, etc.) edit/delete by `appId` today; add a `_appTypeRegistry` entry to enable their creation.

##### Partial-success protocol

The tool ALWAYS creates the rule shell (you get an `appId` back) even if some triggers/actions fail to fully bake. Inspect the result:

- `partial: true` + `partialTriggers: [N, ...]` / `partialActions: [N, ...]` → some pieces are incomplete (this includes any per-item result with `partial: true` OR `success: false`).
- `repairHints: [...]` → concrete next-step instructions.
- Each per-trigger / per-action result has its own `success`, `partial`, `settingsSkipped`, `repairHints`, and `health` block. `success: true, partial: true` on an inner result means the row was written but needs repair.

The right move when `partial: true` is to follow the `repairHints`, NOT to delete the rule and retry from scratch. Tool-only repair via `hub_set_rule(walkStep={...})` / `replaceActions` / `removeAction` can usually finish the job. Only declare failure after exhausting those repair attempts.

#### `hub_set_rule` rule-level boolean flags

Two rule-level toggles are plain mainPage booleans, distinct from the `addTrigger`/`addAction`/`addRequiredExpression` shortcuts. Set them on an EDIT call via the raw `settings` map -- `hub_set_rule(appId=<id>, settings={<flag>: true}, confirm=true)` (they are NOT the condition/trigger-level `rawSettings` escape hatch). Both are mainPage writes, so they auto-commit via the implicit `updateRule` that re-initializes the rule.

- **`useST`** (boolean) -- the "Use Required Expression" flag. `settings={useST: true}` only EXPOSES the Required Expression sub-page (the "Define Required Expression" href); it authors no condition. Prefer `addRequiredExpression`, which sets `useST` for you and builds the actual expression -- setting `useST: true` bare, with no expression, just reveals an empty Required Expression surface.
- **`isFunction`** (boolean) -- the "function mode" flag. `settings={isFunction: true}` marks the rule as a function that returns a value, so other rules can call it as a function. There is no structured shortcut; write it directly.

### Visual Rules Builder tools (in `hub_manage_rule_machine`; read also in `hub_read_rules`)

- **`hub_get_visual_rule(appId?)`** — list every Visual Rules Builder rule (omit `appId`: `{appId, name, version, disabled, paused}` entries — `version` is `'2.0'`/`'1.0'` from the hub's child app type, `paused` is name-suffix detected, so read a single rule for the authoritative `rulePaused`; an omitted `version`/`paused`/`disabled` means undeterminable from the node data, never asserted false) or read one rule's full definition. Every single-rule success response carries `format`: `'graph'` (VRB 2.0, `{version, nodes, edges}`) or `'classic'` (VRB 1.0, `{whenNodes, thenNodes, elseNodes}`). A graph read also carries `editor` (the rule decomposed into `{triggers, conditions, decisionType, thenActions, elseActions, commonActions}` — the shape to edit and send back; `editorError` instead when the stored graph does not decompose) and `activated`. Read master.
- **`hub_set_visual_rule(appId?, name, definition, paused?, confirm)`** — create (omit `appId`; `name` + `definition` required) or edit (the `definition` replaces wholesale, `name` renames, `paused` pauses/resumes). `definition` takes the editor form (recommended), a 2.0 graph, or a classic 1.0 node-list. On create its shape picks the builder version: classic makes a Visual Rule Builder 1.0 rule, editor/graph a 2.0 one, with no translation, and the response echoes the `version` created. Translation is limited to editing a 2.0 rule with a classic definition, and to the create fallback on a hub that can only make one of the two (`translatedFrom: 'classic'`; a 2.0 document aimed at 1.0 is refused, never downgraded). Editor and graph documents are structurally pre-flight validated before anything is created or saved, so a bad definition is rejected as an invalid-params error (`-32602`) listing the problems and leaves no shell behind (only the legacy-create fallback, where a shell already exists, answers `success:false` + `validationErrors`); type names this build does not know are advisory `preflightWarnings` on create and refused on an edit unless the rule already uses them. Responses carry a read-back `verified` flag plus `activated` (false = the hub stored an inactive draft, or the rule is paused: `activated` means the rule actually runs), and the hub's own `storedSuccessfully` / `activatedSuccessfully` verbatim when the firmware sends them. Write master + `confirm=true` + a backup within 24h.
- **`hub_delete_visual_rule(appId, confirm)`** — type-gated delete (refuses ids that are not VRB rules); returns the rule's `predeleteDefinition` so it can be recreated. Write master + `confirm=true` + a backup within 24h.

## Visual Rules Builder reference (`hub_get_visual_rule` / `hub_set_visual_rule` / `hub_delete_visual_rule`)

Visual Rules Builder (VRB) is the PRIMARY rule engine for new automations; each rule is stored as ONE clean JSON definition (no wizard, no settings[] protocol). A VRB rule is: one or more trigger events (OR semantics — any one of them fires the rule), a condition gate, and then/else action branches; VRB 2.0 adds AND **or** OR condition gates and a common action tail that runs after whichever branch was taken. Pretty much everything can be done with it; use `hub_set_rule` (Rule Machine) when something complex is needed — nested or multiple condition blocks, loops, variables and expressions, capture/restore, waiting on a device-state expression (VRB's `wait` waits a fixed duration), or device commands outside the action catalog below.

One installed VRB app holds exactly ONE connected rule; independent workflows go in separate rules.

### `format` and `version` — the definition picks the builder

| | VRB 2.0 (`format: 'graph'`) | VRB 1.0 (`format: 'classic'`) |
|---|---|---|
| Hub platform | 2.5.1.138 and newer | every firmware |
| Definition | `{version: 1, nodes: [...], edges: [...]}` | `{whenNodes, thenNodes, elseNodes}` |
| Created by | an **editor form** (recommended) or graph definition | a classic definition |

A 2.5.1 hub offers both builders, so on CREATE the shape of `definition` decides which one the new rule runs: a classic node-list creates a Visual Rule Builder 1.0 rule, an editor or graph document creates a 2.0 one. Nothing is translated — you get the version you asked for, and the response echoes it as `version`. Prefer 2.0 for anything new; 1.0 exists for parity with rules already built in that editor.

On EDIT the rule's builder is already fixed. Every single-rule read returns `format`, and list mode returns `version` (`'2.0'` / `'1.0'`, from the hub's own child app type, omitted when unparseable). Send the matching shape. The one convenience: a classic definition sent to a 2.0 rule is translated up rather than rejected, and the response says so with `translatedFrom: 'classic'`; the 1.0 builder's unfinished "click to edit" rows (`sampleTrigger` / `sampleCondition` placeholders, which the 2.0 validator refuses) are dropped from the translation and reported in `preflightWarnings`. A classic definition's key set is closed to `whenNodes`/`thenNodes`/`elseNodes` (a misspelled key is refused, not read as "none"), except that the flat body a `hub_get_visual_rule` read returns can be fed straight back: its `success`/`appId`/`format`/`name`/`rawName`/`rulePaused`/`promptHistory` keys are ignored and the top-level `name`/`paused` arguments govern. A 2.0 document aimed at a 1.0 rule is always refused.

Translation is otherwise reserved for older firmware that offers only ONE builder. There the create falls back to whatever that hub makes: a classic definition landing on a 2.0-only hub is translated, while an editor or graph document on a 1.0-only hub is refused rather than downgraded.

### List mode (`hub_get_visual_rule` with no appId)

One entry per rule: `{appId, name, version, disabled, paused}`. `disabled` is the red-X flag; `paused` is detected from a "(Paused)" suffix on the rule's name (VRB has no RMUtils label to cross-check, so a rule literally named "... (Paused)" reads as paused). For the authoritative pause state read the single rule — its `rulePaused` comes straight from the builder JSON. An OMITTED `paused`, `disabled` or `version` means it was undeterminable from the node data; it is never asserted false when it cannot be read.

### RECOMMENDED input: the editor form

The editor form is the same decomposition the hub's own Rule Builder 2.0 UI edits. It carries no merge nodes, no edges and no ports — those are generated for you, exactly as the builder generates them:

```text
{
  "triggers":      [ {"type": "<triggerType>", "config": {...}}, ... ],
  "conditions":    [ {"type": "<conditionType>", "config": {...}}, ... ],
  "decisionType":  "all" | "any",
  "thenActions":   [ {"type": "<actionType>", "config": {...}}, ... ],
  "elseActions":   [ ... ],
  "commonActions": [ ... ]
}
```

- `decisionType` defaults to `all` (every condition must pass); `any` is the OR gate and needs at least one condition. An empty `conditions` list with `all` is an unconditional rule.
- Node `id`s are optional — omit them and stable ids are generated (`trigger-1`, `condition-1`, `then-1`, `else-1`, `common-1`).
- `commonActions` runs after whichever branch executed; supply it only when you want that tail.

**Worked create** — motion OR a mode change, gated on weekday AND after dark, dim the hall on the true branch, turn it off on the false branch, and notify either way:

```text
hub_set_visual_rule(name="Hall light", confirm=true, definition={
  "triggers": [
    {"type": "motion", "config": {"motionSensors": [101], "motionSensorEvent": "Motion starts"}},
    {"type": "systemMode", "config": {"modes": [2]}}
  ],
  "conditions": [
    {"type": "daysOfWeek", "config": {"daysOfWeek": [1,2,3,4,5]}},
    {"type": "timeIsBetween", "config": {"triggerCondition": "sunsetToSunrise"}}
  ],
  "decisionType": "all",
  "thenActions":   [{"type": "setBrightness", "config": {"dimmers": [201], "brightness": 45}}],
  "elseActions":   [{"type": "turnOff", "config": {"switches": [201]}}],
  "commonActions": [{"type": "sendNotification", "config": {"notificationDevices": [301], "notificationMessage": "Hall rule ran"}}]
})
```

**Edit flow** — read, modify, send back. `hub_get_visual_rule(appId=N)` returns `editor` alongside `definition`; change that map and pass it as `definition`. Keep its `structureIds` so the merge/decision node ids (and a `branchMerge` whose common tail you emptied) survive the edit unchanged. The definition always replaces the rule WHOLESALE; there is no partial patch.

### The graph document (what actually goes on the wire)

```text
{"version": 1,
 "nodes": [{"id": "...", "kind": "trigger|merge|decision|action", "type": "...", "config": {...}}, ...],
 "edges": [{"from": "...", "to": "...", "port": "next|true|false"}, ...]}
```

Conditions are NOT flow nodes — they are nested in the one decision node as `{"id", "type", "config"}` entries (no `kind`) under `config.conditions`. Topology:

```text
trigger --+
trigger --+--> triggerMerge --> decision --true--> linear THEN chain --+
trigger --+                              --false-> linear ELSE chain --+--> optional branchMerge --> linear common chain
```

Ports by source: trigger `next`, `triggerMerge` `next`, decision `true` / `false`, action `next`, `branchMerge` `next`. Default structure ids are `trigger-merge`, `decision`, `branch-merge`. `branchMerge` is merge-any continuation, not a synchronization barrier — only the branch that ran continues through it.

Pre-flight validation runs BEFORE anything is created or saved; on failure the call is rejected as an `isError` validation result whose message lists every structural problem it can establish (node reachability is judged only once every branch chain walked to its end), and no child app is created. (Only the legacy-create fallback, where a shell already exists, answers `success: false` + `validationErrors` after cleaning that shell up.) It rejects a `version` other than the integer 1; a non-array `nodes`/`edges`; a blank, duplicate, or unknown-in-an-edge node id; a `kind` outside trigger/merge/decision/action; a missing or non-object `config`; zero triggers; anything but exactly one `triggerMerge` and one decision; a second `branchMerge`; an `any` decision with no conditions; duplicate condition ids; a wrong or duplicated port, or two edges leaving one node on the same port (fan-out); a node reached by more than one path (the two structural exceptions: trigger paths converge only at the triggerMerge, and the then/else branches rejoin only at the branchMerge); a declared node the flow never reaches; a branch that fails to reach the branchMerge when one exists; a trigger not wired to the trigger merge, or a trigger merge not wired to the decision; a non-action node in a branch chain; and cycles. It does NOT check config CONTENTS (device ids, enum spelling, ranges), and it does not refuse a trigger/condition/action `type` outside the catalogs below — newer firmware may know it, so on CREATE that comes back as `preflightWarnings` (so does a rule with no action on any branch) and the hub validator owns the verdict, answering with its own `validationErrors` on the save. On EDIT a running rule is at stake, so a type name this build does not know is refused unless the rule already uses it (the hub having accepted it is the oracle). The editor form's key set is closed: a misspelled key (`conditons`) is refused rather than silently read as "none".

### Trigger catalog (2.0)

Multiple triggers are OR: one matching event enters the decision once.

| `type` | Required config |
|---|---|
| `timeOfDay` | `timeOfDay`: HHmm |
| `sunriseSunset` | `triggerCondition`: beforeSunrise / sunrise / afterSunrise / beforeSunset / sunset / afterSunset; an offset selector also needs the matching `minutesBeforeSunrise` / `minutesAfterSunrise` / `minutesBeforeSunset` / `minutesAfterSunset` |
| `motion` | `motionSensors`; `motionSensorEvent`: "Motion starts" / "Motion stops" / "Motion stops and stays inactive for..." |
| `contact` | `contactSensors`; `contactSensorEvent`: "Contact opens" / "Contact closes" / "Contact opens and stays open for..." / "Contact closes and stays closed for..." |
| `presence` | `presenceSensors`; `presenceSensorEvent`: "Everyone leaves" / "Someone arrives" |
| `acceleration` | `accelerationSensors`; `accelerationSensorEvent`: "Acceleration or vibration has started" / "... has stopped" / "... has stopped and stayed inactive for..." |
| `water` | `waterSensors`; `waterSensorEvent`: "Water is leaking" / "Water sensor is dry" |
| `smoke` | `smokeSensors`; `smokeSensorEvent`: "Smoke is present" / "Smoke has cleared" |
| `co` | `coSensors`; `coSensorEvent`: "Carbon monoxide is present" / "Carbon monoxide has cleared" |
| `alarm` | `alarms`; `alarmEvent`: "Alarm turns on" (siren/strobe/both) / "Alarm turns off" |
| `temperature` | `temperatureSensors`; `temperatureSensorEvent`: "Temperature has risen above..." / "Temperature has fallen below..."; numeric `temperature` |
| `humidity` | `humiditySensors`; `humiditySensorEvent`: "Humidity has risen above..." / "Humidity has fallen below..."; numeric `humidity` 0-100 |
| `illuminance` | `illuminanceSensors`; `illuminanceSensorEvent`: "Illuminance has risen above..." / "Illuminance has fallen below..."; nonnegative `illuminance` |
| `power` | `powerMeters`; `powerMeterEvent`: "Power has risen above..." / "Power has fallen below..." / "Power has become and stayed above..." / "Power has become and stayed below..."; nonnegative `power` |
| `switch` | `switches`; `switchEvent`: "Turns on" / "Turns off" / "Turns on and stays on for..." / "Turns off and stays off for..." |
| `button` | `buttons`; `buttonEvent`: "Pushed" / "Held" / "Released" / "Double tapped"; positive `buttonIndex` |
| `lock` | `locks`; `lockEvent`: "Locked" / "Unlocked" |
| `shock` | `shockSensors`; `shockSensorEvent`: "Shock has been detected" / "Shock has been cleared" |
| `systemMode` | `modes` |

"Stays for..." duration fields are prefixed per trigger: `motionStaysMinutes`/`motionStaysSeconds`, `contactStays*`, `accelerationStays*`, `powerStays*`, `switchStays*`. Each countdown is per device; the opposite state cancels only that device's countdown.

### Condition catalog (2.0)

Nested in the decision. A multi-device state or numeric condition is true when ANY selected device matches, except where noted.

| `type` | Required config |
|---|---|
| `timeIsBetween` | `triggerCondition`: specificTimes / sunriseToSunset / sunsetToSunrise; `specificTimes` also needs `startTime` + `endTime` (HHmm). Crossing midnight is supported. |
| `daysOfWeek` | `daysOfWeek`: nonempty ints, 0 = Sunday |
| `motionCondition` | `motionSensors`; `motionSensorState`: "Motion is active" / "Motion is inactive" |
| `contactCondition` | `contactSensors`; `contactSensorState`: "Contact is open" / "Contact is closed" |
| `presenceCondition` | `presenceSensors`; `presenceSensorState`: "Presence is detected" (ALL devices present) / "No presence is detected" (any not present) |
| `accelerationCondition` | `accelerationSensors`; `accelerationSensorState`: "Acceleration or vibration is detected" / "No acceleration or vibration is detected" |
| `waterCondition` | `waterSensors`; `waterSensorState`: "Water leak is detected" / "Water sensor is dry" |
| `smokeCondition` | `smokeSensors`; `smokeSensorState`: "Smoke is detected" / "Smoke is cleared" |
| `coCondition` | `coSensors`; `coSensorState`: "Carbon monoxide is detected" / "Carbon monoxide is cleared" |
| `temperatureCondition` | `temperatureSensors`; `temperatureSensorState`: "Temperature is above..." / "Temperature is below..."; numeric `temperature` |
| `humidityCondition` | `humiditySensors`; `humiditySensorState`: "Humidity is above..." / "Humidity is below..."; numeric `humidity` 0-100 |
| `illuminanceCondition` | `illuminanceSensors`; `illuminanceSensorState`: "Illuminance is above..." / "Illuminance is below..."; nonnegative `illuminance` |
| `powerCondition` | `powerMeters`; `powerMeterState`: "Power is above..." / "Power is below..."; nonnegative `power` |
| `switchCondition` | `switches`; `switchState`: "Turned on" / "Turned off" |
| `lockCondition` | `locks`; `lockState`: "Locked" (ALL locked) / "Unlocked" (any unlocked) |
| `thermostatModeCondition` | `thermostats`; `thermostatMode`: auto / cool / heat / "emergency heat" / off |
| `systemModeCondition` | `modes` |

Threshold equality is neither above nor below.

### Action catalog (2.0)

| `type` | Required config |
|---|---|
| `turnOn` / `turnOff` / `toggle` | `switches` |
| `setBrightness` | `dimmers`; `brightness` 0-100 |
| `setColorTemp` | `colorTempBulbs`; positive `colorTemp` |
| `setColor` | `colorBulbs`; `color` object with numeric `h`, `s`, `b` (each 0-100) |
| `setLightEffect` | `effectDevices`; positive `effectId` advertised by every selected device |
| `lock` / `unlock` | `locks` |
| `turnOnAlarm` / `turnOffAlarm` | `alarms` |
| `openValve` / `closeValve` | `valves` |
| `openGarageDoor` / `closeGarageDoor` | `garageDoors` |
| `openWindowShade` / `closeWindowShade` | `windowShades` |
| `pushButton` | single `button`; `buttonAction`: Push / Hold / Release / "Double Tap"; positive `buttonIndex` |
| `sendNotification` | `notificationDevices`; nonblank `notificationMessage` |
| `speakNotification` | `speechDevices`; nonblank `speakMessage` |
| `controlPlayer` | `musicPlayers`; `musicPlayerAction`: previousTrack / play / pause / nextTrack / volumeUp / volumeDown / mute / unmute / togglePlayPause / toggleMuteUnmute / stop / setVolume (setVolume also needs `musicPlayerVolume` 0-100) |
| `controlThermostat` | `thermostats`; at least one of `setThermostatMode` / `setThermostatFanMode` / `setThermostatHeatingSetpoint` / `setThermostatCoolingSetpoint` plus its matching `thermostatMode` / `thermostatFanMode` / `thermostatHeatingSetpoint` / `thermostatCoolingSetpoint` |
| `setFanSpeed` | `fans`; nonblank `fanSpeed` supported by every selected device (low / medium-low / medium / medium-high / high / on / off / auto) |
| `setMode` / `setModeUnlessAway` | `mode` (single mode id) |
| `exitAwayMode` | no config |
| `runRule` | positive `appId`; invokes that app's `runRule()`. A rule cannot target itself, and VRB2 does not detect indirect cycles across rules. |
| `wait` | `minutes`, `seconds` — suspends this execution and resumes at the next edge |
| `cancelWait` | no config — cancels every pending wait in this app |
| `sample` | no config, intentional no-op |

A per-device command failure is logged and does not stop the rest of the branch. Waits survive a restart but are cancelled when the graph changes; pausing does not stop a branch already running.

### Common value formats

- Device fields: nonempty arrays of positive device ids (`hub_list_devices`); numeric strings accepted, duplicates rejected. Mode fields: mode ids (`hub_list_modes`); `mode` is a single id. Always ids, never names.
- Times: four-digit 24-hour `HHmm` strings, e.g. "0730", "2215" — no colon. Durations: integer `minutes` / `seconds`, positive and under 24 hours.
- Numeric thresholds are JSON numbers, never numeric strings. Percentages are integers 0-100.
- Enum labels are EXACT and case-sensitive, including the trailing "..." where the table shows one — protocol values, not display text.

### Save semantics: stored vs activated

VRB2 separates STORAGE from ACTIVATION. A document that fails the hub's own validation is still STORED — as an inactive draft — and the rule stops running until it is fixed. So on a graph rule:

- `success` / `verified` — the write landed and the read-back confirmed name, pause state and node counts.
- `activated` — whether the rule actually RUNS. `false` with a non-empty `validationErrors` is an inactive draft; `false` with an empty list means the hub stored the document but reports no live runtime (an `activationError` is passed through when the hub gives one). The response note says which.
- `validationErrors` — the hub's human-readable problems. `validationIssues` is the same list in editor form (`{nodeId, field, message}`) so you can highlight the offending node, and `referencedDeviceIds` lists the devices the graph touched.
- `revision` (reads and writes) — the hub's opaque optimistic-concurrency token for the stored document. `ruleApps` (reads) lists the installed apps a `runRule` action can legally target. `runtimeGraph` (reads) summarizes the live runtime, and is absent when nothing is active.
- `createRoute` (create and restore-recreate) — `createchild` when the per-version child route made the rule, `createVisualRuleBuilderRule` when the legacy builder-page fallback did; the fallback is the only path where the firmware, not your definition, picked the builder. `createRouteNote` appears beside it when the child route answered with a redirect to the new rule's builder page instead of a configure Location (the id was adopted from that redirect).
- Every field in the two bullets above is OPTIONAL on the wire and appears only when the firmware sends it. `hub_get_rule_health(appId)` reads the same verdict later; for a graph Visual Rule `broken: true` means non-empty `validationErrors`.

The serialized document is capped at 100,000 UTF-8 bytes; an oversized one is not stored at all. On the wire the graph travels as a JSON STRING inside `{name, ruleJson}` — the tool handles the double-encoding; always pass `definition` as a normal JSON object.

### Classic 1.0 (legacy hubs)

`{whenNodes: [...], thenNodes: [...], elseNodes: [...]}`. Every node is flat: `triggerType` (or `actionType`), the per-type field keys, `deviceIds` mirroring the device array, `index` (0-based per list), `type` ("when"/"then"/"else"), optional `description`. The 1.0 field keys match the 2.0 tables with two differences: 1.0 `controlThermostat` uses `setMode`/`mode`, `setFanMode`/`fanMode`, `setHeatingSetpoint`/`heatingSetpoint`, `setCoolingSetpoint`/`coolingSetpoint` (2.0 accepts these legacy names too), and 1.0 has none of the 2.0-only types — the `alarm` trigger, `thermostatModeCondition`, `turnOnAlarm`/`turnOffAlarm`, `setLightEffect`, `setFanSpeed`, `runRule`, and `pushButton`'s `buttonAction`. Example: `{"triggerType": "switch", "switches": [59], "deviceIds": [59], "switchEvent": "Turns off", "index": 0, "type": "when"}` / `{"actionType": "turnOff", "switches": [122], "deviceIds": [122], "index": 0, "type": "then"}`. At least one whenNode must be a REAL trigger — a rule whose only whenNodes are `timeIsBetween`/`daysOfWeek` is refused.

Sending a classic definition to CREATE a rule on a hub that offers both builders makes a 1.0 rule; it is not translated. Translation happens in exactly two places: EDITING an existing 2.0 rule with a classic definition, and the create fallback on firmware whose Visual Rules Builder can make nothing but 2.0 children. The conversion is the same either way — whenNodes whose `triggerType` is in the condition catalog become nested conditions, the rest become triggers, thenNodes/elseNodes become the two branches, the decision is `all` — and the response carries `translatedFrom: 'classic'`. The reverse never happens: 2.0-only structure (an OR decision, a common tail) has no 1.0 expression, so an editor or graph document aimed at 1.0 is refused, not downgraded.

### Delete and recovery

`hub_delete_visual_rule(appId, confirm=true)` is TYPE-GATED: it refuses appIds that are not VRB rules and routes them to `hub_delete_native_app` (Rule Machine rules and other classic apps). The response returns `predeleteDefinition` — the rule as it was — so `hub_set_visual_rule` can recreate it. A full replacement edit likewise returns `previousDefinition`. Pause/resume without touching the definition: `hub_set_visual_rule(appId=N, paused=true|false, confirm=true)`.

---

## Developer Mode

The `hub_manage_mcp` gateway exposes self-administration tools that let an LLM agent or CI/CD pipeline manage the MCP rule app's own configuration without manual UI intervention. **Requires the opt-in `Enable Developer Mode Tools` toggle** in the MCP rule app settings page (default OFF). Each successful write is logged at WARN level for audit. If the user sees "Developer Mode tools are disabled" errors, direct them to enable the toggle in the MCP Rule Server app settings.

### hub_manage_mcp (1 tool)

- **`hub_update_mcp_settings`** — update one or more of the MCP rule app's own settings (toggles, log level, tuning params, and the device-access scope `selectedDevices`)
  - Args: `settings` (map of `{key: value}`), `confirm=true`
  - Allowlisted keys (intentionally conservative): `mcpLogLevel`, `debugLogging`, `maxCapturedStates`, `loopGuardMax`, `loopGuardWindowSec`, `enableRead`, `enableCustomRuleEngine`, `useGateways`, `enableMandatoryBPS`, `bypassDeviceAllowlist`, and `selectedDevices`
  - **`bypassDeviceAllowlist`** (bool, default OFF) removes the device-selection boundary when enabled. Device reads, commands, configuration writes, inventory, health checks, dependent lookups, swaps and replacements use native hub endpoints. With bypass OFF, access is limited to selected devices plus MCP-owned children. With bypass ON, these operations can reach any existing device; the Read/Write masters, confirmations and operation-specific eligibility checks still apply. MCP-owned virtual inventory remains ownership-scoped. Hub logs, including device-filtered logs, remain readable regardless of device selection or bypass; the Read master still applies. Explicit scope=all inventory and existing administrative force-delete operations retain their documented broader scope. Native attribute discovery contains reported current states, including their available types and values; unset or cleared attributes can be absent. An explicit missing-attribute read returns null with neverReported, and polling may time out instead of rejecting an unknown name. A command with waitFor can therefore execute before a mistyped attribute times out. Supported-command and argument validation still run before command execution.
  - **`selectedDevices` — the MCP device-access scope** (the `selectedDevices` authorization that `findDevice`/`hub_list_devices` read), set without the Hubitat UI authorize step. Unlike the other (scalar) allowlisted keys, its value is a structured object **because** it is a `capability.*` multi-select that needs a List write plus atomic id validation — it cannot go through the scalar value coercion. Pass `{"mode":"replace"|"add"|"remove", "ids":["42","108"], "allowEmpty":false}` — or a bare array as the replace shorthand (`{"selectedDevices":["42","108"]}` == `{mode:"replace", ids:["42","108"]}`). `replace` sets the authorized set to exactly `ids`; `add` unions `ids` with the current set (safest for "grant one device" — no need to re-enumerate the whole list); `remove` subtracts `ids`. Discover ids with `hub_list_devices(scope='all')` (each carries an `mcpAuthorized` flag).
    - **Atomic validation (replace/add):** every id is checked against the full hub device inventory (`/device/listWithCapabilities/json`, or on platform 2.5.1.173 and later where that endpoint is gone, the `/hub2/devicesList` tree unioned with the `/hub2/vrb/devices` picker feed — a device either source omits is still in the inventory from the other, so it is never rejected as unknown); an unknown id is rejected (`-32602`) with the offending id named and nothing in the whole batch is written. When the id set cannot be vouched for — the tree could not be read, answered empty (against a populated feed, or with no feed answer at all), or the feed listed a device the tree lacks — an id the inventory lacks is answered as "could not validate" (an error, nothing written, retry) rather than as unknown. `remove` does NOT validate ids **because** removing an unknown/already-absent id is a harmless no-op — so a since-deleted device can still be cleaned out of scope (forcing a validation fetch there would block that legitimate cleanup)
    - **Self-lockout guard:** if the resulting set would be empty, the call is refused unless `selectedDevices.allowEmpty=true` (an empty scope blinds the server to every selected device). MCP-managed virtual devices stay reachable regardless
    - On success the response carries a `selectedDevices` sub-key `{mode, authorizedDeviceIds, authorizedCount, added, removed}`. Device visibility changes immediately — MCP clients may need to reconnect
  - **Excluded** from the allowlist: `enableWrite` (footgun — would disable own write path mid-session), `enableDeveloperMode` (lockout protection — must remain UI-only to disable), and `disabled_tools`/`disabled_gateways` (could self-disable this tool — UI-only on the Advanced page)
  - After changing any `enable*` toggle or `useGateways`, MCP clients (Claude Code, etc.) may need to reconnect to refresh the cached tool schema
  - Gated on: `enableDeveloperMode` + the Write master + `confirm=true` + a recent backup

### hub_update_package (top-level, Developer Mode)

`hub_update_package` is its own **top-level** tool (issue #250 pulled it out of the `hub_manage_mcp` gateway), surfaced on `tools/list` only when Developer Mode is on.

- **`hub_update_package`** — full HPM-repair self-deploy of the whole package at a git `ref`, in one call: **OVERRIDES whatever is installed**, the same way Hubitat Package Manager's Repair does, but anchored to `packageManifest.json` AT the `ref` so an unmerged PR installs (HPM repair reads only the published manifest).
  - Args: `ref` (branch/tag/SHA), `dryRun?` (plan-only, no writes), `baseUrl?` (raw-source base override for forks/CI), `confirm=true` (real deploy only)
  - Flow: fetch `packageManifest.json` at `ref` → install every declared library **bundle** first (the hub fetches + unpacks the `.zip`, overwriting libraries in place) → then deploy every declared **app**, the **self** app (`mcp`/`MCP Rule Server`) **last** so its recompile (which can drop the response, #237) is the final act. Deploys the parent app, the child app (`mcp`/`MCP Rule`), and the library bundle (each app's Apps Code class id is resolved at runtime by namespace+name).
  - **Brick-safe:** any failure before the self app save (app/manifest fetch, an unresolved app class, a bundle install, a non-self app) aborts **before** touching the self app — the running server is left exactly as-is and still updatable via `hub_update_app`, which is never modified and always available as the escape hatch.
  - **Hidden from `tools/list` when Developer Mode is off** (not merely runtime-refused). Use `dryRun=true` to fetch + parse + plan with zero writes (no `confirm`/backup needed) and see the bundles + apps that would deploy.
  - Gated on: `enableDeveloperMode` (hidden when off) + the Write master + `confirm=true` + a recent backup

### hub_manage_variables — `hub_delete_variable`

The `hub_delete_variable` op (DESTRUCTIVE, no undo) removes a rule_engine variable. Useful for sweeping orphaned `BAT_E2E_*` artifacts after CI runs, removing stale lease variables, or general cleanup. Connector-namespace deletion is not yet supported via MCP — use the Settings → Hub Variables UI for those.

## Hub Variables

Reference for the hub-variable tools (hub_get_variable, hub_create_variable, hub_delete_variable, hub_create_connector). Per-tool details below.

### hub_get_variable

The returned `source` field says which one matched (the hub-variable namespace is searched first, then rule-engine variables). For hub variables it also returns metadata: `type`, plus `deviceId`/`attribute` when a connector is linked.

### hub_create_variable

Create a new hub variable (global variable visible to apps and Rule Machine), one at a time or several in one call. Single form: name + type + value.

**Bulk form:**
- `variables=[{name,type,value}, ...]` — mutually exclusive with the single form (i.e. mutually exclusive with `name`/`type`/`value`).
- Bulk items are created sequentially; each succeeds or fails independently and the result reports per-item status.

**Why create first (vs hub_set_variable):**
- Use this before `hub_set_variable` for a name that doesn't exist yet — Hubitat's `setGlobalVar` cannot create, only update.
- Drives the Settings → Hub Variables wizard, since creation isn't exposed via the public app API.

**Constraints:**
- Name must not contain any of these characters: `' " \ ~ [ : ] < >`. (This applies to the single-form `name` and to each bulk item's `name`.)
- A String variable's initial value must be non-empty (an empty String reports success but never persists).

**Expose to device-only apps:**
- To also expose the variable to device-only apps, follow up with `hub_create_connector`.

### hub_delete_variable

Useful for sweeping orphaned `BAT_E2E_*` artifacts after CI runs, removing stale lease variables, or general cleanup.

**Why the reference-safety refusal matters:** the tool refuses by default when a child rule app references the variable because deletion would silently break those rules — null lookups → false conditions, and a literal `%varname%` left in substitutions. Pass `force=true` to proceed anyway after acknowledging the breakage.

### hub_list_variable_changes

Audit/debug what changed a hub variable and when, without polling hub_get_variable. This durable buffer retains the latest 200 subscribed changes across app and hub restarts. Names are rewritten on variable rename, and sinceMs includes events at the boundary. The hub's separate location-event history is available through hub_list_device_events with no deviceId; its retention and timestamps differ.

### hub_create_connector

For Number/Decimal vars, Hubitat shows a connector-type chooser (Dimmer/Variable/etc.); pass `connectorType` to pick, default `Variable`. For String/Boolean/DateTime vars, the chooser is skipped. The full Number/Decimal `connectorType` set is: Dimmer, Variable, Volume, ColorTemp, Humidity, Illuminance.

## Dashboards

Reference for the dashboard tools (hub_list_dashboards, hub_get_dashboard, hub_create_dashboard, hub_update_dashboard, hub_delete_dashboard, hub_clone_dashboard). These cover TWO kinds of dashboard, distinguished by the `type` field every tool reports:

- **Easy Dashboard** (`type: "easy"`) — the modern touch-friendly device dashboard: a device list plus tile toggles, navigation, theme, and optional PINs. Config is replaced wholesale.
- **Legacy Hubitat® Dashboard** (`type: "legacy"`) — the classic, richly-customizable dashboard app: an explicit tile grid you lay out yourself (each tile's position, size, template, plus grid colors and fonts). Edited via a full layout replace or granular tile ops.

Per-tool details below.

### hub_list_dashboards

Read-only; each entry carries id, name, and `type` ('easy' or 'legacy'). Easy entries also include tile/theme config. Resolves the dashboard token automatically, so no pinToken is normally needed.

### hub_get_dashboard

Read-only. For an Easy Dashboard: tiles, navigation, devices, and PINs. For a legacy dashboard: its authorized `deviceIds` plus a nested `layout` object (see "Legacy layout shape" below). Read before the wholesale `hub_update_dashboard` and pass its output straight back. A read that partly fails returns `partial: true` with a note — the missing fields are unavailable, not defaulted.

### hub_create_dashboard

Write op. `type` selects the kind: `easy` (default) or `legacy`.

- **Easy** — needs >=1 device. Tiles default off; theme defaults to `legacy` (the theme name, unrelated to the dashboard kind).

  **`options` (optional config object):**
  - `showModeTile`, `showClockTile`, `showCalendarTile`, `showHSMTile` (bool)
  - `showEdit`, `showNavigation`, `showTutorial` (bool)
  - `navigationSelection`
  - `theme` — one of `legacy` | `light` | `dark` | `auto`
  - `dashboardPin`
  - `hsmPin`
- **Legacy** (`type: "legacy"`) — creates the dashboard with an EMPTY layout (no tiles). `name` is required; `deviceIds` is OPTIONAL and sets the dashboard's authorized-device list (NOT tiles). The `options` arg is REJECTED (Easy-only) — a legacy dashboard's look lives in its layout, set via `hub_update_dashboard` after creation. Requires the built-in "Hubitat® Dashboard" app to be installed.

### hub_update_dashboard

Update by id; the behavior depends on the dashboard's kind.

**Easy Dashboard** — wholesale config replace:
- **Read `hub_get_dashboard` first** and pass the FULL config back; this is a wholesale replace, not a partial patch. `name` and `deviceIds` (>=1) are required; any omitted field (PINs included) reverts to its default.
- `options`: same keys as `hub_create_dashboard.options`.
- Passing any legacy-only arg (`layout`, `setOptions`, `addTiles`, `updateTiles`, `removeTileIds`) at an Easy Dashboard is rejected.

**Legacy Hubitat® Dashboard** — edit the label, devices, and/or layout:
- `name` — renames the dashboard's app label.
- `deviceIds` — wholesale-replaces the authorized-device list.
- Layout edits are EITHER `layout` OR the granular ops, never both:
  - `layout` — a full layout object (as returned by `hub_get_dashboard`), replaced wholesale.
  - Granular ops — `removeTileIds`, `updateTiles`, `addTiles`, `setOptions`. They apply in that fixed order in ONE save: removals → updates → adds → options. All validation runs before the save, so a bad op leaves the layout untouched.
- Retry-safe semantics: `removeTileIds` skips an id that is already gone (with a warning), and `addTiles` skips a tile identical to an existing one (with a warning), so a retried call cannot stack duplicates. An `updateTiles` entry for an unknown tile id throws.
- The `options` arg does NOT apply to legacy — pass grid/color/font fields via `setOptions` instead.
- Result: `applied` (the ops that ran), `tileCount`, the saved `layout` echo, and any `warnings`.

**Legacy layout shape:**
- Top-level fields: `cols`, `rows`, `colWidth`, `rowHeight`, `gridGap`, `bgColor`, `iconSize`, `fontSize`, `customColors`, `roundedCorners`, `hideLabels`, and `tiles`. `setOptions` merges any of the top-level fields (the `tiles` and `name` keys are rejected there).
- Each tile: `id` (integer, auto-assigned max+1 on add), `template`, `device` (a device id), `col`, `row` (1-indexed, top-left cell is col 1 / row 1), `colSpan`, `rowSpan` (default 1), and optional `templateExtra`. `addTiles` requires `template`, `col`, and `row`.
- **Device authorization:** a tile's `device` must be in the dashboard's authorized `deviceIds` or the tile renders empty. Adds/updates referencing an unauthorized device still apply but surface a warning; authorize it via `deviceIds`.
- Tile `template` names: acceleration, attribute, battery, bulb, bulb-color, buttons, carbon-dioxide, carbon-monoxide, clock, clock-analog, clock-date, contact, dashboard, date, dimmer, door, door-control, energy, fan, garage, garage-control, generic, hsm, humidity, illuminance, images, level-step, level-vertical, links, lock, mode, momentary, motion, multi, music-player, outlet, power, presence, relay, scene, shades, shock, smoke, switches, temperature, texttile, thermostat, valve, variable-bool, variable-date, variable-decimal, variable-number, variable-string, variable-time, video-player, volume, water, weather, window.
- **localAccess caveat:** a legacy dashboard with 'Allow LAN access' disabled can block its layout endpoint; reads/writes then report the layout as unavailable and note the LAN-access setting.

### hub_delete_dashboard

Devices are NOT deleted. Write op; needs `confirm=true` + a backup within 24h.

- `confirm` (param) — Confirms a recent backup + user approval.
- A legacy dashboard is removed through the classic force-delete (the Easy `/dashboard/delete` endpoint is a no-op for it); removal is confirmed by effect and the result carries its `type`.

### hub_clone_dashboard

Write op; clone-by-value (the source is never touched).

- **Easy** — copies the source's config into a new dashboard (theme may default).
- **Legacy** — creates a new legacy dashboard with the same authorized devices, then copies the source's layout into it wholesale.

## Bundles

Reference for the bundle tools (hub_install_bundle, hub_list_bundles, hub_delete_bundle, hub_export_bundle). A bundle is a packaged .zip of apps, drivers, and/or libraries.

### hub_install_bundle

- **Verify the install** afterward with hub_list_libraries / hub_get_source.
- **Endpoint routing:** uses /bundle2/uploadZipFromUrl on firmware >= 2.3.8.108, else the legacy /bundle/uploadZipFromUrl (the chosen path is also surfaced in the result's `endpoint` field).

### hub_list_bundles

Each entry: id, name, namespace, a private flag, and a `contains` summary of the apps/drivers/libraries the bundle delivers.

### hub_export_bundle

`saveAs` filename sanitization: `.zip` is appended if missing, and non-filename characters are replaced with `_`. The result returns the final `fileName`.

## Rooms

Reference for the room tools (hub_list_rooms, hub_get_room, hub_create_room, hub_update_room, hub_delete_room). hub_delete_room's destructive behaviour is under "Destructive Write Tools".

### hub_get_room

A device the MCP server cannot reach is returned with `accessible=false` and no `currentStates` (label "(device not accessible via MCP)").

### hub_create_room

To move EXISTING devices into an existing room, set each device's room via hub_update_device -- do NOT create a room for that.

### hub_update_room

Renaming a room preserves device assignments, but may require updating automations/dashboards that reference the room by name.

## Slow writes over Streamable HTTP

Surfaced via `hub_get_tool_guide(section='slow_ops')`. Hubitat's cloud relay can end one HTTP request while hub-side work continues. MCP 2026-07-28 request-to-request continuation solves this without changing transport, installing an extension, or asking the caller to invent a token.

### Automatic request-to-request continuation

The modern path applies to `hub_set_rule`, `hub_set_native_app`, multi-rule stop/start batches through `hub_call_rule`, `hub_clone_native_app`, `hub_import_native_app`, the slow driver-code lifecycle writes `hub_create_driver`, `hub_update_driver`, and `hub_delete_item(type="driver")`, `hub_delete_debug_logs`, `hub_manage_virtual_device`, and `hub_update_device`.

The first request reserves the operation and starts its first slice at once; a write that finishes within that request's wait budget returns an ordinary `resultType: "complete"` result in one round trip, so a client that never echoes `requestState` still completes fast writes. Only work still running at the budget returns `resultType: "input_required"` with an opaque `requestState`; compatible MCP clients automatically repeat the same tool call with that state. Each resumed request advances or coordinates one bounded slice and gets a fresh relay deadline; native wizard slices may run in the internal worker. If no client request resumes a checkpoint within about five seconds, the server resumes it itself and keeps going to completion or the eight-slice cap, so a client that never continues still gets the whole write; a client request that arrives later observes or replays as usual. Clone and import checkpoints resume the same way (their later phases read only the checkpoint, so the import JSON is not retained). `hub_get_info` returns `recentWrites`: the last ten continuation-eligible writes with their status (`running`, `paused_resuming`, `finished`, `finished_with_error`) and identifiers, so a client that saw only a generic error can learn what happened with one read. Every state-only reply, every background completion and every paused write that expires unresumed is logged in the MCP log (`hub_get_logs` with `mode="mcp"`, component `mrtr`) at info or warn, so a client-side error can be traced without enabling debug logging. The logical call eventually returns one normal `resultType: "complete"` result describing all slices.

The state is bound to the original leaf tool and exact original arguments. A mismatched, unknown, or expired state executes nothing. A fresh identical call while the original is active rejoins that same `requestState` and observes the running owner; every response to that replay is marked `rejoined: true`, and it cannot reserve or run a second write. This lets a client safely replay a first request whose HTTP response was lost while the work is still running. A write that completed within its first request has no state the client could echo, so a lost response there is the same exposure as any single-request write: read the target before repeating it. A client that cannot render `input_required` shows a generic client-side error with no result body while the hub keeps running the write; the same rule applies -- read the target, and know that an identical repeat within the active window joins the running write rather than starting a second one. To INTENTIONALLY run the same write twice while the first record is still live, vary the arguments (for example the rule name or an added comment field) or wait out the record TTL -- a byte-identical repeat always coalesces. The terminal result remains replayable briefly under the same requestState so losing only the final HTTP response does not rerun the operation.

Why `input_required`/`requestState` rather than the spec's Tasks primitive: each continuation round is one bounded HTTP leg of ONE logical tool call -- the server never holds a client-facing job object with its own lifecycle, and compatible clients (the official SDKs included) continue automatically inside a single `call_tool()` with no polling code. Tasks model work that outlives the request exchange with independent status/cancel semantics; the one operation here that genuinely outlives its exchange (package deployment, which recompiles this app) returns immediately and publishes a durable, request-correlated outcome instead. `input_required` with no `inputRequests` is the spec's state-only continuation shape: the server is asking the client to continue the exchange, not to answer a question.

### Slow log and diagnostic reads

When the transport has a time budget, `hub_get_jobs`, `hub_get_performance_stats`, and native log reads through `hub_get_logs` use background fetches and the same `requestState` continuation. Cold MCP history recovery also serves logging status, `hub_get_info`, `hub_report_issue`, and detailed `hub_get_custom_rule` diagnostics. A warm read can finish on its first call. Reads hold no write lease, and their log payloads stay outside persisted continuation records.

`hub_get_device` (every mode) and `hub_list_devices` (including virtual devices) also use background reads on budgeted modern requests. Fast reads finish in one response; slower reads continue with the same arguments and `requestState`. Each independent device read fetches fresh data. Only continuation and replay share its snapshot, preserving any device-details pagination cursor. Changes to device access or loss of the snapshot require a fresh read. Device payloads remain in bounded memory rather than persisted continuation records. Legacy device calls retain their synchronous behavior.

`hub_delete_debug_logs` waits for recovery before clearing, then retains its small terminal result so replay cannot clear again. Reload recovery reads existing native history; old state-backed entries are discarded once when updating to native storage. Legacy clients that receive `status: "in_progress"` repeat the same read or clear call.

### Global write concurrency cap

Every actual write obtains a server-side lease, whether it uses MRTR or completes in one request. `maxConcurrentWrites` defaults to 2 (1 fully serializes writes; 0 disables the cap). A new write at capacity is refused as `too_many_writes_in_flight` before dispatch, so parallel agents or a client burst cannot overwhelm the hub. Active MRTR calls and the background `hub_update_package` worker keep their slot until completion; abandoned leases expire automatically. Reads, gateway catalog calls, schema-only probes, `hub_call_device_replace(list_options=true)`, and `hub_update_package(dryRun=true)` do not count. No client token or extra argument is involved.

### Older clients

Clients negotiated below MCP 2026-07-28 do not understand requestState. They retain the existing `status: "in_progress"` remainder envelope for bounded multi-step writes. Completed steps are already committed; reissue only the returned remaining work. This is a compatibility fallback, not a second polling protocol.

The advanced `relayBudgetMs` setting (default 6000 ms, 0 disables) controls cloud slices. `lanBudgetMs` defaults to 0; set it just below a LAN client's request timeout only when needed.

### Package deployment

`hub_update_package` is intentionally asynchronous instead of MRTR because a full repair can take minutes and recompiles this app. A real call validates and schedules the repair, then immediately returns `status: "in_progress"` with `requestId`. Do not submit it again: the server retains the reservation until that exact worker clears it or a matching terminal `lastSelfDeploy.requestId` proves it finished. Poll `hub_get_info.lastSelfDeploy` until its `requestId` matches; its `success` and `error` fields are the terminal outcome. During normal execution, keep polling rather than retrying the write. If a worker is abandoned, the next write may remove its marker only after the 10-minute recovery lease has expired and no live worker owns it; retry the deploy only after that recovery condition. `dryRun: true` remains synchronous.

### Other writes

No custom operation-token or deployment-job protocol is exposed. If a non-continuation write loses its response, read current hub state before deciding whether it is safe to retry.
