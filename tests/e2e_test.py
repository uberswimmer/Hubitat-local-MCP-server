Hubitat MCP Server — End-to-End Test Runner

Sends real JSON-RPC 2.0 requests to a Hubitat MCP Server endpoint and validates
responses. Requires a running hub with the MCP server app installed.

Configuration: tests/e2e_config.json (gitignored) or env vars
    HUBITAT_HUB_URL, HUBITAT_APP_ID, HUBITAT_ACCESS_TOKEN

Usage:
    python tests/e2e_test.py                    # run all tests
    python tests/e2e_test.py --group devices    # run one group
    python tests/e2e_test.py --test trigger     # run tests matching substring
    python tests/e2e_test.py --cleanup-only     # just sweep BAT_E2E_ artifacts
    python tests/e2e_test.py -v                 # verbose request/response logging

    Deliberately NOT a HubitatMcpClient subclass, and deliberately without any of its
    conveniences (gateway auto-routing, MRTR continuation, op timings, catalog maps).
    The endpoint serves two eras and every currently shipping production client speaks
    the legacy one, so the only way to keep proving that half of the contract is to put
    the 2025 wire shape on the wire verbatim. Use it ONLY inside the legacy_protocol
    group -- the rest of the suite rides 2026-07-28 by contract (HubitatMcpClient._send
    asserts its own headers to keep it that way).

    Every difference from the modern client is a deliberate part of the era:

      - No Mcp-Method / Mcp-Name headers. 2026-07-28 invented them; a legacy client that
        sent them would not be a legacy client, and the server must never require them
        of one.
      - MCP-Protocol-Version carries what `initialize` negotiated (REQUIRED on every POST
        since 2025-06-18), which is never the modern revision. Before the handshake the
        requests are headerless, which is what a pre-2025-06-18 client sends.
      - No params._meta protocol stamping.
      - Results are read VERBATIM and never expected to carry resultType: jsonRpcResult
        stamps it only on modern-era requests, because a legacy client parses an empty
        result with a strict schema (the TypeScript SDK's EmptyResultSchema rejects
        unknown keys), so a stray stamp turns a keepalive into a protocol error.

    # pinToken-gated list (create succeeded but the dashboard isn't listable) skips,
    # since that is a hub-provisioning gap the e2e hub does not control.

        """hub_update_app(triggerUpdated=<instance>) must fire updated() on a running instance
        after the code save AND leave that instance's configured settings intact.

        The lifecycle refresh submits the classic "Done" form to /installedapp/update/json --
        the same submit the install-commit uses. It previously POSTed to
        /installedapp/configure/<id>/mainPage, which is the HTML UI page: current firmware
        answers POST there with 405, so the refresh never fired and the caller got
        updatedFired:false + partial:true. Only a live hub proves which route the firmware
        accepts, so this scenario is the regression pin.

        Sharing the Done-submit with the install path brings a blanking hazard with it: that
        submit re-sends every input on the page, so on an already-CONFIGURED instance it must
        round-trip the stored values rather than re-apply the code's defaults. The target
        therefore declares a bool input defaulting to FALSE which the test sets to TRUE before
        the refresh -- so "settings survived" is distinguishable from "defaults re-applied",
        which would read back false.

        It also declares a DEVICE input (capability.switch, multiple) assigned the scaffold
        switch, because that is the shape real apps overwhelmingly have and the one that cannot
        be answered off-hub. /installedapp/configure/json renders a device setting as an OBJECT
        with value=null, which is unencodable, so the Done body is built from statusJson
        appSettings instead: _rmLiveSettingsFromStatus rebuilds the assignment from
        deviceIdsForDeviceList into the id List the form CSV-encodes. If this hub reports device
        settings some other way the assignment is re-submitted as "" and the assertion below
        fails -- precisely the signal wanted, since the shape handling would then need extending
        rather than being assumed correct.

        # there returns response_too_large. Only the _backup_ siblings are swept; the live

        #     (e2e-deferred-native-rules.json from Layer 4, e2e-deadman.json from the
        #     watchdog) and hub_write_file snapshots the previous copy first. Matching on the
        #     "_backup_" marker rather than on named stems covers every such file including
        #     ones added later, and can never match a LIVE e2e-*.json, which has no marker.
