// protocol and are SHARED across domains -- the native-RM tools (now in
// McpNativeRulesLib) plus the devices, variables, app-cloner, code-management,
// and visual-rules libraries all call them. They stay in the host app because a
// library-private home would force a forbidden cross-#include (AGENTS.md).
//
// The wire-format contract works around Hubitat's SmartApp parent-type check
// (addChildApp('hubitat', 'Rule-5.1', ...) is blocked) by hitting the hub's
// admin-layer endpoints directly via session cookie:
//
//   Create:   GET  /installedapp/createchild/<ns>/<appName>/parent/<pid>  → 302
//   Read:     GET  /installedapp/configure/json/<id>[/<subpage>]
//   Status:   GET  /installedapp/statusJson/<id>
//   Update:   POST /installedapp/update/json  (x-www-form-urlencoded)
//   Button:   POST /installedapp/btn
//   Delete:   GET  /installedapp/forcedelete/<id>/quiet
//
// The capability-multiple contract: multi-device capability inputs need
// THREE paired fields in the same POST (settings[name]=csv, name.type=
// capability.X, name.multiple=true). Omitting `.multiple=true` silently
// rewrites the AppSetting DB flag to false and every subsequent page
// render throws `Command 'size' is not supported by device` against RM's
// list-of-devices code paths. _rmBuildSettingsBody emits the full group
// from the input schema automatically, so callers never have to remember.

    //                 Field disappears from schema after write but persists in
    //                 settings as a plain enum string.
    //   useLastDev.N -- runCommand's "use last device" checkbox written during
    //                   addAction. Disappears from doActPage schema after write
    //                   but persists in settings as "true"/"false".
    //   time1      -- Certain Time trigger's time/mode label written during
    //                 addTrigger. Disappears from selectTriggers schema after
    //                 the wizard advances past it, but persists in settings.
    //   Any other submitOnChange-but-not-re-rendered field in RM 5.1.
    //
    // HOW it works: the /installedapp/configure/json response includes BOTH
    // configPage (current rendered inputs) AND settings (all persisted app
    // settings). When a field disappears from configPage but the value is in
    // settings, the write succeeded -- route to applied, not skipped.

/**
 * Walk a sequence of [idx, actType, actSubType] entries (in numerical
 * order) tracking IF / Repeat block depth via a stack. Returns the list
 * of structural issue strings (empty list = balanced).
 *
 * Used by _rmCheckRuleHealth for post-mutation detection AND by the
 * pre-flight refusal paths in _rmDeleteAction / _rmAddAction /
 * _applyNativeAppEdit's replaceActions handler — they all build a
 * projected sequence (current minus removals plus additions) and compare
 * projected against current with `projected - current` set diff. Any
 * NEW issue not present in current means the mutation introduces damage
 * and is refused. (Size-only comparison would allow damage-shuffling on
 * already-broken rules — e.g. adding an END-IF to a rule with an open
 * Repeat keeps the issue count flat but swaps "Repeat never closed" for
 * "END-IF closes a Repeat block — mismatched closer".)
 *
 * Asymmetric refusal at the call sites: openers (ifThen / repeat /
 * repeatWhile) added alone are allowed (normal multi-step build state).
 * Branch keywords (elseIf / else) and bare closers (endIf / stopRepeat)
 * are refused if they would render orphaned, because they have no valid
 * follow-up step the caller would naturally do next.
 *
 * Partial-commit handling: an entry with `actType` set but `actSubType`
 * null -- or one carrying an explicit `partial: true` -- is REPORTED as a
 * partial-commit issue and then skipped as an opaque block boundary. It is
 * not walked into and not silently treated as a leaf: the actType-only
 * halfway state the add-action false-fail race leaves behind is exactly
 * what a caller needs told, since walking past it would mask a real
 * imbalance and treating it as a leaf would invent one.
 *
 * Groovy's List.pop() removes from the FRONT of a List; the walker uses
 * `<<` for append and `removeAt(size-1)` for tail-pop to preserve the
 * conventional stack semantics.

        device_authorization: '''## Device Authorization (CRITICAL)

**Exact match rule:**
- If user specifies a device name that EXACTLY matches a device label (case-insensitive OK), use it directly
- Example: User says "turn on Kitchen Light" and device "Kitchen Light" exists → use it

**Non-exact match rule:**
- If no exact match exists, search for similar devices
- Present options to user and WAIT FOR EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION before using any device
- Example: User says "use test switch" but only "Virtual Test Switch" exists → ask "Did you mean 'Virtual Test Switch'?"

**Tool failure rule:**
- If a tool fails (e.g., hub_manage_virtual_device returns an error), report the failure to the user
- Do NOT silently fall back to using existing devices as a workaround
- Example: If creating a virtual device fails, don't just grab an existing device to use instead

**Why this matters:**
- Wrong device could control critical systems (HVAC, locks, security)
- User trust depends on AI only controlling what they explicitly authorized''',

        best_practice_reference: '''## Best-Practice Reference

Acknowledgment key: bps-ack-299

The "Require Best-Practice Guide Acknowledgment" gate is ON by default. While it is on, every write
tool requires you to pass this exact key as the `bestPracticeKey` argument on the call --
e.g. `bestPracticeKey: "bps-ack-299"`. Read this section once, then include that argument on each
write for the rest of the session. Reads, hub_get_tool_guide, and hub_update_mcp_settings are
never gated, so you can always reach this guide and (if needed) toggle the gate off. The key is
published only here, so supplying it proves you consulted these practices before writing.

Reactive hints are always on (no toggle): when a write tool errors, the error gains a one-line
pointer to THAT tool's own guide section -- follow it for the failing tool's reference.

### Write-tool best practices

- Rules: prefer native Rule Machine (hub_manage_native_rules_and_apps / hub_set_rule) over the
  legacy custom_* MCP rule engine for new automation work -- the custom engine is legacy and
  closed to new feature work.
- Devices: resolve the exact target with hub_list_devices before acting; device IDs compare as
  strings, and a wrong device could control a critical system (HVAC, locks, security).
- Destructive writes: create a backup with hub_create_backup within 24h and pass confirm=true;
  destructive tools refuse otherwise.''',

        hub_admin_write: '''## Admin, System & Destructive Write Tools

This section covers the hub-admin and system tools (hub info, location modes, HSM status, system settings) AND the destructive write tools. The read-only / non-destructive entries below (e.g. hub_get_info, hub_list_modes, hub_get_hsm_status, the create/rename/activate mode actions) need no confirm; only the destructive writes require the pre-flight checklist.

### Destructive Write Tools - Pre-Flight Checklist

The destructive/confirm-tier write tools require these steps (ordinary writes need only the Write master):
1. Backup check: Ensure a hub backup exists within the last 24 hours (hub_create_backup, or any backup in hub_list_backups scope=hub_local -- scheduled backups count; the gate checks the hub's own list when this app's record is stale)
2. Inform user: Tell them what you're about to do
3. Get confirmation: Wait for explicit "yes", "confirm", or "proceed"
4. Set confirm=true: Pass the confirm parameter

### Tool-Specific Requirements

**hub_reboot** - 1-3 min downtime, all automations stop, scheduled jobs lost, radios restart. Only when user explicitly requests.

**hub_update_firmware** - Installs the hub's pending platform/firmware update, then the hub self-reboots (5-10 min full downtime). Confirm a pending update via hub_get_info (platformUpdate) first; backup <24h + confirm=true required to apply; poll progress with statusOnly=true. Only when user explicitly requests.

**hub_shutdown** - Powers OFF completely, requires physical restart. NOT a reboot. Only when user explicitly requests.

**hub_call_zwave (action=repair_start)** - 5-30 min duration, Z-Wave devices may be unresponsive. Best during off-peak hours. exclusion_start and node_remove unpair/disrupt devices (confirm=true).

**hub_call_destructive_ops** - IRREVERSIBLE / DISRUPTIVE, by `target`. target=zwave|zigbee|matter: reset unpairs EVERY device on that radio; a firmware flash can brick hardware if interrupted. target=network: disconnect_wifi/disconnect_ethernet drop that link (the hub may go unreachable). target=cloud: disable severs Alexa/Google, cloud dashboards, cloud firmware updates, and subscription features until enable restores them. Backup <24h, explicit target+action+confirm=true, never power-cycle during a flash.

**hub_delete_device** - MOST DESTRUCTIVE, NO UNDO. For ghost/orphaned devices, stale DB records, stuck virtual devices.
- Use hub_get_device to verify correct device
- Warn if recent activity or Z-Wave/Zigbee (do exclusion first)
- All details logged to MCP debug logs for audit

**hub_delete_room** - Devices become unassigned (not deleted). List affected devices first.

**hub_delete_item (type=app|driver|library)** - Remove app instances via Hubitat UI first (apps). Change devices to different driver first (drivers). For libraries, check that no apps/drivers reference the library via #include namespace.Name before deleting -- deletion breaks any code that still includes it. Auto-backs up before deletion.

### hub_call_zwave (Z-Wave lifecycle action grouping + routing)

- Action groups: repair_start/repair_cancel + repair_node (network rebuild); inclusion_start/inclusion_stop + grant_keys/grant_code (S2 pairing); exclusion_start/exclusion_stop; node_refresh/node_rediscover/node_reinitialize + refresh_stats (per-node maintenance); node_replace + node_replace_stop; node_remove (failed-node removal); antenna_test_start/antenna_test_continue; smartstart_delete.
- S2 pairing payloads: grant_keys takes the granted security classes, e.g. {S2AccessControl:true, S2Authenticated:true, S2Unauthenticated:false, S0Unauthenticated:false}; grant_code (DSK confirmation) takes e.g. {accept:true, securityCode:'12345'}.
- Poll repair/operation progress with hub_get_radio_details(include_status=true). (repair_start duration/disruption and off-peak guidance: see the repair_start note above.)
- Related radio tools: enable/disable, region, and long-range channel via hub_set_zwave; radio reset (unpairs every device) and Z-Wave firmware flashes via hub_call_destructive_ops.

### hub_set_zigbee (configure the Zigbee radio: enable/disable, channel/power, radio settings, per-device ping)

- Idempotent config, one operation per call; read current values first with hub_get_radio_details(radio='zigbee'). Disabling the radio strands every Zigbee device and is confirm-gated (confirm=true + backup <24h).
- **Channel changes** can drop devices that do not follow the new channel (they may need re-pairing); a channel/power update returns a `warning` describing the disruption.
- **Radio settings** (rebuild_on_reboot / ping_inactive) MERGE over current values -- an unspecified flag is preserved, so pass only the flag you intend to change.
- **Sibling tools:** for reboot / rebuild-network / channel-scan use hub_call_zigbee; for radio reset or firmware flash use hub_call_destructive_ops.

### hub_call_destructive_ops — firmware-flash action reference

The radio firmware-flash `action` values (the bullet above summarizes these as "a firmware flash"; an interrupted flash can brick hardware — never power-cycle during one):
- `device_firmware_start` — Z-Wave device firmware OTA. Requires `node_id` + `file_name` (`file_name` comes from hub_get_radio_details(include_firmware=true)); optional `target_index` defaults to `node_id`.
- `device_firmware_abort` — abort an in-progress Z-Wave device flash. Requires `node_id`.
- `zwave_chip_firmware` — flash the hub's own Z-Wave radio chip (no extra args).
- `zigbee_firmware` — update the Zigbee radio to the latest firmware (no extra args).

(Matter supports only `reset`, no firmware flash.)

### hub_call_matter (Matter radio: enable/disable, pair, open pairing window)

- After `action=pair` (the 11- or 21-digit Matter setup code), poll commissioning progress with hub_get_radio_details(radio='matter', include_status=true).
- Matter requires a C-8 / C-8 Pro hub on supported firmware; the failure note repeats this.
- `action=open_pairing_window` opens a share window for a commissioned node_id; the response carries the setup code to add that device to another fabric.
- To RESET the Matter fabric (wipes commissioning, unpairs every Matter device) use hub_call_destructive_ops(target='matter', action='reset').

### hub_set_zwave (configure the Z-Wave radio: enable/disable, region, long-range channel)

- Config updates preserve the radio's other current settings: a region or long-range-channel change keeps the current `enabled` and `secureJoin` values. The hub's zwaveDetails update is a full-replacement endpoint (it takes the complete param set, not a partial patch), so the tool reads current state first and overrides only what you changed.
- Disabling the radio strands every Z-Wave device, so it is confirm-gated (confirm=true plus a hub backup <24h).
- Scope routing: for repair / inclusion (join + S2 grants) / exclusion / per-node maintenance use hub_call_zwave; for radio reset or firmware flash use hub_call_destructive_ops.

### hub_call_zigbee (non-idempotent Zigbee radio ops)
- Actions: radio_reboot (restart the Zigbee chip), rebuild_network (rebuild the mesh), channel_scan (trigger an energy scan). No confirm gate, but the Write master applies.
- rebuild_network takes time; Zigbee devices may be briefly unresponsive during the rebuild.
- Read channel_scan results with hub_get_radio_details(include_channel_scan=true).
- For enable/disable, channel, or power use hub_set_zigbee (idempotent config); for radio reset or firmware flash use hub_call_destructive_ops.


### hub_update_app (modify existing app code, and/or enable/configure OAuth)

- **Self-update guard rationale:** the tool refuses to overwrite the MCP server's own app source or OAuth unless Developer Mode is on because a bad self-update bricks the MCP loop — the server app's own OAuth backs the live `/mcp` token.
- **`triggerUpdated`:** OPTIONAL post-save lifecycle refresh. Set it to the running instance appId to fire `updated()` so subscriptions/schedules re-initialize. UI Save does NOT fire `updated()`, so this is opt-in only.
- **`oauth` param shape:** `{enabled (bool, default true), client_id?, client_secret?, refresh_secret? (bool, regenerate the secret)}`. Omit `client_id`/`client_secret` to preserve current values; if they are unreadable the tool refuses (`success:false`) rather than blanking them. Resulting credentials return under `result.oauth`.

### hub_create_app (install new app code, then instantiate a running instance)

**codeAppId second-step mode** (pass the `codeAppId` from a prior code-install `hub_create_app` call to instantiate already-installed code AND commit the install; mutually exclusive with the code-install args):
- Submits the config page's Done, firing `installed()`/`initialize()` so the instance's schedules and event subscriptions register.
- Works for apps whose first page installs with defaults.
- A required first-page input with no default blocks the auto-Done (same behavior as the Hubitat UI) -- in that case the install cannot be auto-committed.


### hub_update_app / hub_update_driver — expectedVersion (optimistic-lock guard)

`expectedVersion` aborts the write with `conflict:true` on a version mismatch. Stringified integers are coerced; an explicit null is rejected. In bulk driver updates, put `expectedVersion` inside each `updates[]` entry.


### hub_call_device_command

**Uncertain command outcome:** `outcomeUnknown: true` means the native command request failed without proving whether the device acted. Read the device state or event history before deciding whether to retry; blindly repeating a non-idempotent command can apply it twice.

**Response `state` snapshot (single-device form only -- the `commands` form returns none).** Returns a native `state` snapshot with per-attribute values and freshness timestamps after dispatch. It may still show the previous state if the driver has not reported the effect. To confirm the resulting state, pass `waitFor` and check convergence, or read hub_get_device_attribute separately. With `waitFor`, the snapshot follows polling and the `waitFor` result reports whether the expected value converged. Native command rejection returns success: false for both selected and bypass-accessible devices.

**`parameters` arg.** Omit for no-arg commands like on/off. Each element is a string; numbers and JSON-object values are passed as strings (e.g. `["{\"hue\":0,\"saturation\":100,\"level\":50}"]`) and coerced hub-side.

**`waitFor` arg.** comparator (eq/ne/gt/gte/lt/lte/between) and stableForMs (debounce) work as on hub_get_device_attribute. BLOCKS the request up to timeoutMs and queues concurrent MCP calls; reuses the hub_get_device_attribute poll engine.

**`commands` arg (several devices in one call).** Up to 20 entries of `{deviceId, command, parameters?}`, sent in the order given. Reach for it whenever an intent touches more than one device ("turn off the kitchen lights", "close all the shades"): the per-call round trip -- not the hub actuating the device -- is nearly the whole cost. Measured on a live hub over LAN: one command ~1.0s end to end; six sent separately ~4.4s (~0.73s each); the same six Z-Wave switches as one batch ~1.5s; a batch of 1, 2 or 4 flat at ~0.95s. Firing separate calls in parallel does NOT help; the hub serialises them anyway. Devices behind a bridge carry real per-device time that batching cannot remove -- six Bond-bridged shades batched came back at ~2.75s, against ~5.0s sent separately.

- **Mutually exclusive with `deviceId`/`command`**, and cannot be combined with `waitFor` -- that would block a hub thread per device.
- **Batch entries return no state snapshot.** Confirm with hub_get_device_attribute's `deviceIds` form: one call to fire, one to confirm.
- **What it does NOT change.** The hub still actuates the devices one at a time, so they do not all move simultaneously. What disappears is the protocol overhead, not the hub's own work.
- **Entries are independent.** Mixed devices and mixed commands. A bad entry (unknown id, unsupported command) is reported in its own `results[]` slot and the remaining entries are still sent; `success` is true only when every entry was sent. A partly-failed batch carries `failedDeviceIds` plus `partial: true` -- re-send ONLY those ids, because the successful entries have already actuated. Malformed input -- a missing deviceId, a `parameters` value that is neither an array nor a string, more than 20 entries -- is rejected before anything is sent, so a bad request never actuates part of a batch.
- **A very large batch of slow bridged devices can stop early.** As the request nears the relay time budget the batch returns `stoppedEarly: true` with `remainingCommands` -- the untried tail, verbatim. Re-send exactly that in a new call; the attempted entries already went.
- **Groups and scenes are better for a set you command repeatedly** -- one device to command, with the hub doing the fan-out. `commands` is for the set nobody defined in advance: the arbitrary collection of devices a spoken sentence resolves to, which cannot be anticipated as a group without predicting the sentence.

### hub_call_device_swap

Drives the hub's built-in Swap Device tool; use to migrate device references to new hardware or swap out a failing device without editing each automation.

The hub only offers compatible replacement devices: an incompatible to_device_id fails with a structured error listing the compatible options.

### hub_call_device_replace

DESTRUCTIVE. Re-points `old_device_id` onto `new_device_id`'s node; the new hardware adopts the OLD id, so the old device's rules and dashboard tiles stay intact. Use when a Z-Wave/Zigbee device died and you paired a compatible replacement.

Differs from `hub_call_device_swap`, which instead migrates references onto the NEW device's id.

**Two-step flow:**
1. Call with `list_options=true` first to read the hub's compatible replacement candidates for `old_device_id` (read-only, no confirm).
2. Pick one as `new_device_id`, then call again with `confirm=true`.

**Apply-path pre-flight** (in addition to the standard destructive checklist above — backup <24h, user approval, `confirm=true`): a compatible `new_device_id`.

**Parameters:**
- `old_device_id` — the device to replace; its id is preserved. Comes from `hub_list_devices`.
- `new_device_id` — the compatible replacement device; its hardware is adopted under the old id. Required to apply; omit when `list_options=true`.
- `confirm` — required to apply (omit for `list_options`); must be true. Confirms a backup <24h + user approval (see the standard destructive checklist above).

### hub_create_device

Creates a device from a driver TYPE id (the `id` from `hub_list_drivers(include='all')`). Requires the Write master + `confirm=true`. Scope and routing:

- For built-in LAN/integration/cloud and software/component drivers with no pairing flow.
- NOT for Z-Wave/Zigbee/Matter hardware -- pair those with `hub_call_zwave`/`zigbee`/`matter`. A radio driver created here is a non-functional orphan shell; the response warns.
- For MCP-managed virtual devices use `hub_manage_virtual_device` instead.


### hub_get_info

Read-only diagnostics tool. Beyond the default payload (model, firmware, uptime, memory, temperature, DB size, MCP stats, security/toggle settings), it always returns two extra fields and supports two optional deep-dive flags. Use it for health checks, version lookups, or when triaging hub performance.

**Always returned (regardless of the flags below):**
- `platformUpdate` — the pending hub FIRMWARE/platform update (see the hub_update_firmware entry above, which installs it).
- `safeMode` — whether the hub is running in Safe Mode (from /hub2/hubData; absent if /hub2/hubData was unreadable).

**`includeHealthAlerts=true`** (default false): returns the hub's full health-alerts block from /hub2/hubData — every /hub2/hubData alert flag plus the hub's message strings, under `healthAlerts`. Covers radio offline, backup failures, low memory, DB bloat, and weak mesh. `platformUpdate` and `safeMode` are returned whether or not this flag is set.

**`includeAppUpdate=true`** (default false): also checks GitHub for a newer MCP (Rule) Server APP version, returned under `appUpdate`. The check is ASYNCHRONOUS — the first call may return `latestVersion: 'unknown (check in progress)'`; call again in a few seconds. This is DISTINCT from `platformUpdate` (the hub's own firmware). To INSTALL a pending hub firmware update, use hub_update_firmware.

**PII / Read master gating:** Location/PII fields (name, local IP, timezone, coordinates, zip code) are returned ONLY when the Read master is enabled; otherwise they are omitted.

### hub_list_modes

- Use it to get valid mode names + ids (hub-specific, e.g. Day/Night/Away) before activating/renaming/deleting a mode.

### hub_manage_mode

Create, rename, delete, or activate a hub location mode — the full mode-management surface in one tool. Modes (Day/Night/Away/…) are hub-wide states that apps and rules trigger on. Read the current modes + ids with `hub_list_modes` first.

**Actions:** `create` | `rename` | `delete` | `activate` a location mode.

- **delete** is irreversible and breaks any app/rule referencing that mode, so it requires `confirm=true` + a recent backup. The `confirm` flag (must be `true` for `action=delete`) confirms a backup <24h AND that breaking those mode references is intended.
- **create / rename / activate** do NOT require confirm.
- **icon** (OPTIONAL, for create/rename) — a Font Awesome name, e.g. `fa-moon`, `fa-sun`.

### hub_set_mode_manager

Configure the hub's Mode Manager — select which manager runs and/or set its per-mode conditions. Mode Manager is the automation that changes the location mode automatically.

**`manager`** — which Mode Manager to activate:
- `builtIn` — the Integrated Mode Manager
- `legacy` — the legacy Mode Manager app
- `app` — a 3rd-party mode-manager app, valid only when one is installed

**`conditions`** (OPTIONAL) — per-mode automation conditions to set. Replaces the Integrated Mode Manager's per-mode condition set (`POST /modes/easyModeManager/json`). Same shape as `hub_list_modes.modeManager.easyConditions` (keyed by mode id). Read the current shape from `hub_list_modes.modeManager.easyConditions` first, then modify-then-write (read-modify-write that block).

Read state back with `hub_list_modes`.

### hub_get_hsm_status

Use this to check the security-system state or to confirm a change made via hub_set_hsm.

### hub_set_system_settings

Set hub-GLOBAL settings: hub name, time zone, location (latitude/longitude), zip code, temperature scale, admin-UI dark mode, and network config. All fields optional — pass only what changes.

**Write model:**
- `latitude`, `longitude`, `timeZone`, `zipCode`, `temperatureScale` (plus `hubName`) are written together via ONE granular endpoint that read-merges the current values, so omitted fields keep their current value.
- `darkMode` and the network legs are each applied via SEPARATE setters, with NO read-back of the current value. `darkMode` is applied via `/hub/applyDarkMode`.
- Read back applied values with `hub_get_info`.

**Safety gating:**
- Changing `timeZone` REBOOTS the hub (1-3 min downtime).
- Any `network` change can DISCONNECT the hub.
- `timeZone` and `network` changes therefore require `confirm=true` plus a backup <24h. All other fields need only the Write master (no confirm). The `confirm` parameter (must be `true`) confirms a backup <24h exists and that the disruption is intended.

**Network config (`network` object):**
- All sub-fields optional; only the legs you provide are applied, in order — IP mode → Ethernet autoneg → WiFi — and the sequence is NOT atomic, so a mid-sequence failure leaves the earlier legs applied (see the `applied` array in the response).
- `ipMode='static'` requires `address` + `netmask` + `gateway` (`nameserver` optional).
- `ipMode='dhcp'` uses `nameserver` + `useDNSFallover`.
- `ethernetAutoneg` toggles Ethernet autonegotiation.
- `wifiSsid` (+ `wifiPassword`) joins a WiFi network.

**Parameter examples / formats:**
- `timeZone` — IANA time zone ID, e.g. `America/New_York`. Changing it reboots the hub — requires `confirm=true` + a recent backup.
- `latitude` — decimal degrees, e.g. `40.7128`.
- `longitude` — decimal degrees, e.g. `-74.006`.
- `zipCode` — postal/zip code, e.g. `10001`.
- `temperatureScale` — `F` or `C`.

### hub_update_firmware

Uses the hub's own cloud-update path (`/hub/cloud/checkForUpdate` + `/hub/cloud/updatePlatform`).

On apply, the `available` field returns the checkForUpdate payload verbatim: `version`, `upgrade`, `status`, `releaseNotesUrl`, `beta`, `hubCount`, and the hub owner's `accountEmails`.

Poll install progress with `statusOnly=true` (`status` is IDLE when none is running); the endpoint goes dark during the reboot, then confirm the new `firmwareVersion` via `hub_get_info`.


### hub_update_mcp_settings

**`selectedDevices` — the MCP device-access scope.** Pass `{"mode":"replace"|"add"|"remove", "ids":[<device id strings>], "allowEmpty":<bool>}` -- or a bare array as shorthand for replace (`{"selectedDevices":["42","108"]}` == `{mode:"replace", ids:["42","108"]}`).

- `replace` sets the authorized set to exactly `ids`.
- `add` unions `ids` with the current set (safest for "grant one device" -- no need to re-enumerate the whole list).
- `remove` subtracts `ids`.

For replace/add every id is validated against the full hub device list (discover ids via `hub_list_devices(scope='all')`, each carries an `mcpAuthorized` flag) -- one unknown id rejects the whole batch and nothing is written; `remove` does not validate (removing an absent/since-deleted id is a no-op). Refuses to empty the scope unless `allowEmpty:true`.

**Deliberately NOT allowlisted:**
- `enableWrite` -- would disable this tool's own write path mid-session.
- `enableDeveloperMode` -- lockout protection; must stay UI-only to disable.
- `disabled_tools` / `disabled_gateways` -- could self-disable this tool.

**Schema refresh / reconnect.** Changing an `enable*` toggle or `useGateways` reshapes `tools/list`; changing `selectedDevices` changes which devices are visible. So MCP clients may need to reconnect to refresh cached schemas / device visibility.

### hub_update_package

Deploys every declared library bundle + app from the manifest at `ref`, saving the running self app LAST (its recompile can drop the response, #237). Does NOT touch app instances, undeclared drivers, or anything outside this package's manifest.

**Brick-safe:** if ANYTHING before the self app save fails (app/manifest fetch, an unresolved app class, a bundle install, a non-self app), it aborts BEFORE touching the self app -- the running server is left exactly as-is and still updatable via hub_update_app, the always-available escape hatch. Self-modification is gated by this tool's own enableDeveloperMode check (it deploys by Apps Code CLASS id, so hub_update_app's instance-id self-update guard does not fire here).

**Why an unmerged PR installs:** plain Hubitat Package Manager Repair reads only the PUBLISHED manifest, so it can't reach an unmerged PR's artifacts. This tool instead anchors to `packageManifest.json` AT `ref`.

**Developer Mode visibility:** when Developer Mode is off the tool is hidden from `tools/list` entirely (catalog-hidden, not merely runtime-refused).

**`baseUrl`:** per-call source URLs are built as `<baseUrl>/<ref>/<path>` (`baseUrl` carries no trailing slash, no ref/path). It exists to point at forks / CI branches on a different remote.

### hub_update_mcp_settings — bypassDeviceAllowlist (DANGEROUS escape hatch)

`bypassDeviceAllowlist` (bool, default OFF) removes the device-selection boundary when enabled. Device reads, commands, configuration writes, inventory, health checks, dependent lookups, swaps and replacements use native hub endpoints. With bypass OFF, access is limited to selected devices plus MCP-owned children. With bypass ON, these operations can reach any existing device; the Read/Write masters, confirmations and operation-specific eligibility checks still apply. MCP-owned virtual inventory remains ownership-scoped. Hub logs, including device-filtered logs, remain readable regardless of device selection or bypass; the Read master still applies. Explicit scope=all inventory and existing administrative force-delete operations retain their documented broader scope. Its effect is independent of Developer Mode. Native device operations require the MCP app's Hub Security credentials when Hub Security is enabled; without them, native reads and writes cannot authenticate. Native attribute discovery contains reported current states, including their available types and values; unset or cleared attributes can be absent. An explicit missing-attribute read returns null with neverReported, and polling may time out instead of rejecting an unknown name. A command with waitFor can therefore execute before a mistyped attribute times out. Supported-command and argument validation still run before command execution. Attribute discovery is reported-state only on EVERY path (selected devices included): `attributes` in list/detail reads and `declaredAttributes` in details mode carry current states, and an attribute the driver declares but has never set is absent, not unsupported (`attributeCoverage.declarationsComplete: false` says so in-band). Attribute values keep the driver-declared type: an attribute whose native record carries `dataType: NUMBER` is a JSON number, every other value is a string, and the type is stable per attribute; the `hubitat://context` and `hubitat://context-summary` resources are served from one bulk hub read and carry string values without unit suffixes. Whole-population reads -- the two context resources and every `hub_list_devices` filter -- come from that single bulk read, never one native read per device; only a device the bulk read does not cover costs a per-device read (capped at 20 for the resources, with the rest reported as state unavailable). One unreadable device no longer fails `hub_list_devices`: it is listed with `metadataUnavailable: true`, excluded from any active filter, named in `metadataUnavailableIds`, and the response carries `partial: true`; a bypass inventory whose id set could not be vouched for is returned with `idsComplete: false` instead of an error. Swap and replace both verify a bypass-only id against native metadata before any native request. The legacy custom-rule engine keeps its own selection-only device references; bypass does not extend to it.

**selectedDevices** is the MCP device-access scope. Pass {"mode":"replace"|"add"|"remove", "ids":[<device id strings>], "allowEmpty":<bool>} -- or a bare array as shorthand for replace ({"selectedDevices":["42","108"]} == {mode:"replace", ids:["42","108"]}). 'replace' sets the authorized set to exactly ids; 'add' unions ids with the current set (safest for "grant one device" -- no need to re-enumerate the whole list); 'remove' subtracts ids. For replace/add every id is validated against the full hub device list (discover ids via hub_list_devices(scope='all'), each carries an mcpAuthorized flag) -- one unknown id rejects the whole batch and nothing is written; 'remove' does not validate (removing an absent/since-deleted id is a no-op). Refuses to empty the scope unless allowEmpty:true.

**Deliberately NOT allowlisted** by hub_update_mcp_settings: enableWrite (would disable this tool's own write path mid-session), enableDeveloperMode (lockout protection -- must stay UI-only to disable), disabled_tools/disabled_gateways (could self-disable this tool).

### Custom drivers

Use `customDriver={namespace, name}` instead of `deviceType` to instantiate any user-installed driver:
- `namespace` and `name` must match exactly as the driver is registered on the hub
- Use `hub_read_apps_code(tool="hub_list_drivers")` to discover installed driver namespace + name values
- Mutually exclusive with `deviceType` -- supply exactly one
- On failure, the tool surfaces an `IllegalArgumentException` with a `hub_list_drivers` hint

MCP-managed virtual devices:
- Auto-accessible to all MCP tools without manual selection
- Appear in Hubitat UI for Maker API, Dashboard, Rule Machine
- Use hub_manage_virtual_device(action="delete") to remove (not hub_delete_device)

### hub_manage_virtual_device

**Partial virtual results:** `success: true, partialSuccess: true` means a created device or some inventory entries are usable, but native metadata or namespace verification is incomplete. Inspect the warnings and unreadable device IDs. A created ID/DNI already exists: repair or re-read it rather than creating another device. An entirely unreadable inventory returns `success: false, isError: true`; a partial inventory must not be treated as complete.

**action="create" — `deviceType` vs `customDriver`:** Supplying both is an error, including a blank/whitespace `deviceType` supplied alongside `customDriver`.

**action="create" response shape:**
`{success, message, tips, device: {id, name, label, deviceNetworkId, driverNamespace, driverType, typeName (deprecated alias for driverType -- prefer driverType), capabilities, commands, attributes}}`

**action="create" error surfaces:**
- Built-in `deviceType` not-found surfaces as a platform error (`isError`).
- `customDriver` not-found surfaces as an `isError` validation result with a `hub_list_drivers` hint.

**`customDriver` object:** Both fields (`namespace`, `name`) are required.

**action="delete" response shape:**
`{success, deviceId, deviceNetworkId, deviceLabel, message}`

        update_device: '''## Device inspection and updates

Call `hub_get_device(deviceId=..., mode="configuration")` before an update. It reports the fields that are applicable and writable for this device, declared preference types/options/ranges/defaults and current saved values, driver identity, and source/read status. A saved false, zero, empty string or null is distinct from an unset value; a driver default does not prove the setting was saved. Use `mode="details"` with optional `sections` for wider inspection.

For smaller expanded reads, pass `fields=[]` to discover `availableFields`, then select exact names. Configuration selection applies to preference names, editable property names and device-info keys. Details selection applies to section keys; attributes also accepts an individual attribute name. Commands and jobs use the row indices returned by `availableFields`, so duplicate or unnamed rows remain selectable. Omitting `fields` retains the full selected sections.

If even one selected value exceeds the response budget, the tool returns `contentFormat="json-fragment"`, a `content` string and `nextCursor`. Repeat the same read with that cursor, concatenate the fragments in order, then parse the joined JSON. Pages retain the original redacted snapshot despite later telemetry changes. Continue within five minutes with the same device, mode, sections and fields. Expiry, eviction or a server reload requires restarting without cursor. At most eight snapshots and 4 MiB of content are retained in memory; select fewer fields if the budget is exceeded. Device authorization is checked on every page.

Every update requires the Write master and applicable tool permissions. When mandatory best-practice acknowledgment is enabled, put `bestPracticeKey` inside the gateway's `args` alongside the patch.

| Properties | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| `label`, `name`, `deviceNetworkId` | Device identity; network-ID changes require confirmation and backup. |
| `dataValues`, `preferences` | Data-section values and declared driver preferences. Inspect configuration first. |
| `room`, `enabled`, `showOnHome`, `defaultCurrentState`, `tags` | Room, availability, Home visibility, Status-column attribute, and replacement tag set. |
| `deviceTypeId`, `zigbeeId` | Driver and radio identity where applicable; confirmation and backup required. |
| `notes`, `defaultIcon` | Device note and icon override; empty string clears. |
| `maxEvents`, `maxStates`, `spammyThreshold` | Native history limits (1-2000) and event-alert threshold (100-2000). |
| `dashboardIds`, `meshEnabled`, `meshFullSync` | Applicable dashboard/mesh assignments; confirmation and backup required. |
| `retryEnabled` | Command retry where the native device exposes it. |
| `homeKitEnabled`, `amazonAlexaEnabled`, `googleHomeEnabled` | Supported and installed assistant assignments; confirmation and backup required. |

Omitted properties are preserved. The complete patch is validated before writes begin. A runtime partial failure reports per-property successes and errors; inspect the result before retrying.

**Preferences format:**
`{"pollInterval": {"type": "number", "value": 30}, "debugLogging": {"type": "bool", "value": true}}`

Use the preference's declared type and constraints from configuration mode; bool and boolean declarations are supported. Unknown names are refused. Omit preferences to preserve them. Clearing an optional preference requires an explicit entry such as `{"debugLogging":{"clear":true}}`; null, empty strings, whitespace and empty arrays are rejected. Do not combine clear with value. Required preferences cannot be cleared. Read values and driver defaults do not constitute a write request. An unreadable schema/readback is reported separately from an unknown name or a value that did not persist. Room names use case-insensitive exact matching. `tags` replaces the full tag set; an empty array clears it.

If an unset enum reports `multiple: null`, check `driverSource` or metadata captured before clearing, then supply `multiple: true` or `multiple: false` alongside `value` when restoring it. For example, `{"colors":{"value":["red"],"multiple":true}}` restores a declared multi-select enum; do not guess its selection cardinality.

        rules: '''## Rule Structure Reference

NOTE: this section describes the LEGACY custom MCP rule engine (the custom_* tools). For native Rule Machine rules built via hub_set_rule (addTrigger), the periodic shape is DIFFERENT -- use periodic={frequency, everyN, ...}, NOT {type, interval, unit}. See hub_get_tool_guide section "set_rule_reference" for the native addTrigger periodic field shape.

### Rule JSON Structure
{"name": "Rule name", "description": "Optional", "enabled": true, "triggers": [...], "conditions": [...], "conditionLogic": "all|any", "actions": [...]}

- periodic: {"type":"periodic","interval":5,"unit":"minutes|hours|days"}
- mode_change: {"type":"mode_change","fromMode":"Away","toMode":"Home"} — both optional

### hub_get_custom_rule

Read-only inspect of an existing custom rule. It stays usable when the Custom Rule Engine toggle is OFF (read-only mode): you can still list and inspect existing custom rules, while create/modify/delete are hidden.

### hub_create_custom_rule

Creates a new automation rule in the LEGACY custom MCP rule engine (the `custom_*` tools described by the Rule Structure Reference above). The custom MCP rule engine is now considered legacy: existing custom rules continue to fire and this engine will receive bug fixes if reported, but new feature work goes to native Rule Machine. THIS tool creates MCP-managed sandbox rules that fire as installed apps but are NOT visible in Hubitat's RM UI; only use when explicitly asked for that or for backward compatibility with existing `custom_*` rules.

At least one trigger and at least one action are required. The per-type fields for every trigger, condition, and action are in the Triggers / Conditions / Actions reference above. Concrete shape examples for the array members:
- `triggers` member: `{"type":"time","time":"sunset"}`
- `conditions` member: `{"type":"mode","mode":"Night"}`
- `actions` member: `{"type":"device_command","deviceId":"42","command":"on"}`

### hub_update_custom_rule

Updates an existing MCP custom-engine rule in place; only the fields you supply change (use `enabled=true/false` to enable/disable).

- Replacing `triggers`/`conditions`/`actions` overwrites that whole array -- it is **not** a merge. If you only want to tweak part of a rule, get the current rule via `hub_get_custom_rule` first, then send back the full modified array.
- For the trigger/condition/action structure, see the Triggers / Conditions / Actions reference above in this same section (Rule Structure Reference).
- Verify changes after updating.
- **Read-only mode (Custom Rule Engine toggle OFF):** only the `enabled` field is accepted. Structural changes (`triggers`, `conditions`, `actions`, `name`) require the toggle to be ON.

### hub_test_custom_rule

Use this to validate a rule's logic after creating or updating it. Returns per-condition results, `wouldExecute`, and the list of actions that would have run. Applies only to MCP custom rules; for native Rule Machine use `hub_manage_native_rules_and_apps`.

### hub_export_custom_rule

Returns the full rule data plus a device manifest listing all referenced devices, and writes a `.json` file to the File Manager (pass `saveAs` for the filename; defaults to a generated name).

### hub_import_custom_rule

Use this to restore a backup or copy a rule between hubs. Import creates a NEW rule with a fresh ruleId; it does not overwrite an existing rule.

- **deviceMapping (optional)** remaps the exported device IDs onto this hub's devices, e.g. `{"old_id": "new_id"}`. Unmapped IDs are kept as-is, so verify device references after import.
- Verify the rule after creation.

### hub_clone_custom_rule

Duplicates an existing MCP custom-engine rule into a new, independent rule with its own ruleId (same triggers/conditions/actions and device references as the source).

- The clone starts **DISABLED** so you can review and adjust it before activating via `hub_update_custom_rule(enabled=true)`.
- Use this to base a new rule on an existing one.
''',

        backup: '''## Backup System

### Hub Backups
- hub_create_backup creates full hub database backup
- A hub backup within 24 hours is required by the destructive/confirm-tier write tools (ordinary writes need only the Write master); the gate accepts this app's own record OR any backup in the hub's local backup list (scheduled/UI backups count)
- hub_create_backup itself is exempt from the prior-backup requirement (it IS the backup)

### Source Code Backups (Automatic)
- Created when using hub_update_app, hub_update_driver, hub_update_library, hub_delete_item
- Stored in File Manager as .groovy files
- Persist even if MCP uninstalled
- Max 20 kept, oldest pruned
- Rapid edits preserve original (1-hour protection)

### Rule Backups (Automatic)
- hub_delete_custom_rule auto-backs up to File Manager as mcp_rule_backup_<name>_<timestamp>.json
- Restore via: hub_read_file → hub_import_custom_rule
- Skip backup: set testRule=true when creating/updating

### hub_create_backup

Also sets the hub's automatic-backup schedule. Pass a `schedule` object {hour 0-23, minute 0-59, localBackupFrequency, cloudBackupFrequency (days; enum 0,1,2,3,5,7,14,21,28; 0=off)}. `scheduleOnly=true` (with a schedule) sets the schedule only and creates no backup. Omitted schedule fields are read-merged (keep their current value). If cloud backup is or stays enabled you MUST pass `cloudBackupPassword` (the hub does not expose it for read-back), or pass `cloudBackupFrequency=0` to disable cloud backup -- otherwise the call is refused (a wholesale write would blank the password).

### hub_list_backups

`scope=source` (default) lists auto-created code backups, each with a `backupKey`. `scope=hub_local` / `hub_cloud` / `hub` / `all` return whole-hub DB backups under `hubLocalBackups` / `hubCloudBackups`. A local backup's `name` and a cloud backup's `path` feed hub_restore_backup and hub_delete_backup.

### hub_get_backup

Reads the saved source from one backup -- use it to inspect or diff a prior version before restoring (to re-apply, use hub_restore_backup, not this tool). Large sources are omitted from the response (`sourceTooLargeForResponse=true`) with a File Manager download link instead.

### hub_restore_backup

- `scope=source` (default) -- restore an app/driver/rule by `backupKey` (for deleted code use hub_create_*; deleted rules DO recreate).
- App/driver source restores report `undoAvailable=true` only after verifying the pre-restore file. Use the returned `preRestoreBackup` handle to undo. A failed required pre-restore capture aborts before saving the source. Only a retry whose live source already matches the target backup may succeed without verified undo, with `undoAvailable=false` and a warning; do not rely on an older undo record for that restore.
- Native rule restore requires confirmed absence from the app inventory before recreating an unreadable rule. If the config read fails and absence cannot be confirmed, inspect the rule/inventory and retry when readable.
- `scope=hub_local` (`fileName`) and `scope=hub_cloud` (`path` + `cloudBackupPassword`) -- restore the WHOLE hub DB and REBOOT the hub.
- `scope=hub_uploaded` -- upload an external `.lzf` fetched from `backupUrl`, then restore (open-world).''',

        file_manager: '''## File Manager

Files stored at http://<HUB_IP>/local/<filename>

**File name rules:**
- Must match ^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$
- No spaces, no leading period
- Valid: my-config.json, backup_2024.txt
- Invalid: .hidden, my file.txt

**Chunked reading:**
- Use offset and length for files >60KB
- Each chunk must be <60KB
- Follow `nextOffset` while `hasMore` is true to read the next chunk

### hub_list_files

Use to discover available files before reading one with hub_read_file, or to confirm a write/backup landed. **`filter`:** case-insensitive substring match on the file name -- pass `filter: "backup"` to find backups instead of paging the whole listing and matching client-side. **Cursor pagination:** page size 100 -- omit the cursor for an unbounded list; pass "" for the first page and iterate `nextCursor`.

### hub_read_file

Use after hub_list_files to fetch a named file (config, backup, exported rule/app, CSV). For files >60KB use the chunked-reading loop above.''',

        performance: '''## Performance Tips

**hub_call_device_command with `commands` -- the biggest single win on a multi-device intent:**
- The per-call ROUND TRIP dominates, not the hub actuating the device. Measured on a live hub over LAN: one command ~1.0s end to end, six separate commands ~4.4s (~0.73s each).
- So collapse them: the same six Z-Wave switches as one `commands` batch measured ~1.5s -- and a batch of 1, 2 or 4 devices is FLAT at ~0.95s, which is the signature of the round trip being the entire cost. Reach for it whenever an intent touches more than one device ("turn off the kitchen lights", "close all the shades").
- Firing the separate calls in parallel does NOT help -- the hub serialises them anyway (see "Make tool calls sequentially" below).
- It does not make the devices move simultaneously; the hub still actuates one at a time. For a directly-attached device that costs almost nothing, but a device behind a bridge carries real per-device time that batching cannot remove: six Bond-bridged shades batched came back at ~2.75s, against ~5.0s sent separately (six Z-Wave switches batch at ~1.5s).
- Entries are independent, so mixed devices and mixed commands go in one batch. Max 20. A partly-failed batch reports failedDeviceIds plus partial:true -- re-send only those ids; the rest already actuated.
- Batch entries return NO state snapshot, and waitFor is not accepted with `commands`. To confirm, follow with hub_get_device_attribute using deviceIds (multi-device convergence): one batch to fire, one poll to confirm -- two round trips for the whole group.
- A very large batch of slow bridged devices can stop early at the relay time budget: the result carries stoppedEarly:true with remainingCommands, the untried tail verbatim, to re-send in a new call.
- For a set commanded repeatedly, a group or scene beats both: one device to command and the hub fans out. `commands` is for the ad-hoc set that was never defined in advance.

**hub_list_devices:**
- Use detailed=false for initial discovery
- Inventory counts: count is the number returned on this page; total is the matching count before pagination; unfilteredTotal, when present, is the count in the requested device scope before filters or pagination (not necessarily the whole hub).
- With detailed=true, paginate: 20-30 devices per request
- Make tool calls sequentially, not in parallel
- Server-side label/capability filtering: use labelFilter (substring) and capabilityFilter (exact capability name) instead of fetching all devices and filtering client-side
- format='ids' returns a flat integer array (cheapest for "which devices exist" queries)
- fields=[...] projects named fields only: currentStates and attributes are the expensive ones (per-device hub reads) -- project those out to save hub CPU; capabilities and commands are in-memory and cheap. id is always included regardless of projection. Unknown field names throw.

**hub_list_device_events:**
- Default: most-recent events for a device (deviceId + limit)
- Add hoursBack for up to 7 days of relative history; omit deviceId for location-level events (mode/HSM/hub variable)
- Add since for an absolute bookmark -- return only events AFTER an exact timestamp (ISO-8601 in the same format the tool emits in date/sinceTimestamp -- a numeric offset in either spelling (-0600 or -06:00), e.g. 2026-06-23T10:00:00.000-0600; a trailing Z for UTC and a millis-less variant are also accepted -- or epoch milliseconds). since takes precedence over hoursBack; a future since yields an empty list. Both since and hoursBack route to history mode
- Change-watching loop: record a returned event date, run your action, then pass that date back as since to get exactly the new events. The response echoes sinceMode ("explicit" when since drove it, "relative" for hoursBack) and the bounding field (since or hoursBack)
- appId (mutually exclusive with deviceId) returns the events an installed app/rule emitted; rows are {name, value, description, date}
- Use the attribute filter to reduce data volume

### hub_get_logs (history, logging status, and filters)

Use mode='hub' (default) for native app/device logs, mode='mcp' for structured MCP entries, or mode='status' for MCP log level, counts, and capacity. MCP mode keeps level/component/ruleId/limit/cursor filters and the existing diagnostic fields used by hub_report_issue. Debug and info are retained alongside warnings and errors when admitted by the configured threshold. After reload, MCP history recovers from this app's native Past Logs; retention shares Hubitat's approximately 1 MB rolling history with other apps and devices. The memory view keeps up to 100 entries without storing the ring in app state.

The following filter pipeline applies to hub mode. Current three-column native timestamps use the hub's timezone; timezone-free since/until arguments still mean UTC.

- Device scope: `deviceId` filters hub-wide history regardless of device selection or bypass (logs are hub diagnostics, including history for deleted devices). The hub answers an empty list for an unknown id and a quiet device alike, so a device-filtered read carries `deviceIdResolved` (true when an entry or a native identity read proves the id; false means the id names no device on the hub).
- Filter pipeline order: scope (deviceId/appId, server-side) -> level -> source -> pattern -> patterns -> time window (since/until) -> limit.
- `pattern` / `patterns`: the regex matches the log message field ONLY (use `source` for app/device-name substring matching); it is compiled once and throws on invalid regex syntax. A pathological regex like `(.*)*` may hang the matcher -- prefer simple alternation (`error|fail`) or anchored prefixes.
- `pattern` and `patterns` are compatible: when both are supplied, both apply simultaneously.
- `patternMode` is case-insensitive ('ANY' and 'any' both work).
- `since`/`until` relative offsets are subtracted from now; the max relative offset is 30d and a larger offset throws -- use an ISO-8601 timestamp for longer ranges.
- Timestamps without a TZ marker (e.g. '2024-01-15T10:30:00' or '2024-01-15 10:30:00.000') are parsed as UTC. '0m' / '0d' is a degenerate `since` that filters out everything older than now (useful for test harnesses, rarely otherwise).
- `until` defaults to now (no upper bound); pair it with `since` for a window, e.g. since='2h', until='1h' means '1 to 2 hours ago'.
- `cursor`: filters + limit apply first, then the cursor pages within the filtered result (page size 100).

### hub_get_radio_details (read-only Z-Wave/Zigbee/Matter radio surface)

- Covers radio details (firmware, home/PAN ID, channel, device nodes), mesh topology, per-node state, lifecycle status pollers, channel scan, SmartStart entries, and firmware-eligible devices.
- Pairs with the write tools in hub_manage_radio (hub_set_zwave / hub_set_zigbee / hub_call_zwave / hub_call_zigbee / hub_call_matter) and the destructive resets/firmware in hub_call_destructive_ops.
- include_topology shape (Z-Wave/Zigbee only): Z-Wave returns nodes+connectors plus the raw route table; Zigbee returns children+neighbors+routes.
- node_id result location: Z-Wave node state lands under result.nodeState (plain text; 'Done' when idle); Matter commissioning status (radio='matter') lands under result.matterPairStatus.
- include_status (result.status) contents: Z-Wave repair stage, heal-running flag, exclusion status, join discovery, antenna-test progress, node-replace status/info, and Zigbee network status (panId/extendedPanId/networkState). Matter commissioning status is per-node instead: radio='matter' + node_id.
- include_channel_scan: run a fresh scan with hub_call_zigbee action='channel_scan' first, then read result.channelScan.
- include_smartstart: each entry's nodeDSK feeds hub_call_zwave action='smartstart_delete'.
- include_firmware: shape {devices:[{nodeId,label}], files}; feeds hub_call_destructive_ops firmware actions.

### hub_get_device_health (device-staleness check + LAN/WAN network probes)
- Stale checks cover selected devices plus MCP-owned children with bypass OFF, and all native hub devices with bypass ON. Use hub_list_devices(filter='virtual') for an ownership-scoped child inventory.
- Health reads activity from one native device-tree request. An explicit null activity is reported as never; missing or invalid activity metadata is reported as unavailable with metadataUnavailable: true, and counted as unknown.
- pingHosts/tracerouteHost/speedtest are independent read-only network probes, runnable in any combination; each param documents its own mechanics and result location.
- pingHosts: each entry is sent through hubitat.helper.NetworkUtils.ping() and reported under pingResults with reachable/rttAvg/packetLoss. Hostnames are not resolved -- pass IPs only.
- tracerouteHost: hostnames are rejected -- pass an IP (dotted-quad).
- speedtest: fixed 10 MB Hubitat S3 blob, no caller input; a few seconds on a fast link, up to ~90s on slow ones.
- Budgeted modern calls run the complete health check in a background read; continuations and terminal replay reuse its result without repeating probes or the LED blink. Traceroute keeps its 30s timeout and speedtest its 90s timeout. Long probes or combinations may exceed the eight-slice continuation window or the client's retry limit; `slow_read_timeout` is an explicit failure and does not cancel the worker. Do not automatically start another health check after a timeout.
- **Cursor pagination (staleDevices):** page size 100. Omit the cursor to get all stale devices in one response (subject to the response-size guard). unknownDevices and healthyDevices are always returned in full alongside the page.

### hub_get_metrics (hub metrics + the hub's own health alerts)
- `current` snapshot fields: timestamp, timestampEpoch, freeMemoryKB, internalTempC, databaseSizeKB, uptimeSeconds, uptimeFormatted. `current` also carries locally-derived warning notes when thresholds are crossed: memoryWarning (<50 MB free), temperatureWarning (>70 °C), databaseWarning (>500 MB) — with softer memoryNote/temperatureNote variants below those thresholds.
- `trends`: recent history points {timestamp, freeMemoryKB, internalTempC, databaseSizeKB, uptimeSeconds}. `trendPoints` chooses how many (default 10, max 50). `trendPointsAvailable` = total rows on file; `historyFile` = the CSV name in File Manager (mcp-performance-history.csv).
- Trend history is sparse/stale: the hub never auto-samples, so points exist only from earlier recordSnapshot=true calls and reset if that CSV is cleared. Call recordSnapshot=true periodically to build a trend — it appends one row to the performance-history CSV (rolling 500-row window) and is the tool's ONLY write side-effect (default false = read-only).
- `healthAlerts`: the hub's own active health alerts pulled from /hub2/hubData — {safeMode, active (currently-firing alert flags such as hubLowMemory / hubLargeDatabase / zwaveOffline / localBackupFailed / weakZigbee), details (full alert-flag map + the hub's message strings)}. Covers radio offline, backup failures, low memory, DB bloat, weak mesh, and safeMode. Complements the locally-derived warnings on `current` (and may differ in threshold from them). null if /hub2/hubData was unreadable.

**hub_get_memory_history:**
- Free OS memory and CPU-load history (the platform's own timestamped ring buffer; each entry has freeMemoryKB and cpuLoad5min)
- limit caps the most-recent entries returned (default 100); limit=0 returns all (the hub may hold thousands of rows)
- Cursor mode pages within the limit-filtered entries; with limit=0 + cursor it pages the FULL ring buffer (every history row, not just a limit-filtered window). Pass "" for the first page and iterate nextCursor (page size 100)

### hub_get_performance_stats (per-device/app metrics it reports)

- Reports per device/app: method call counts, % busy, state size, events, states, hub actions, and pending events.
- The `sortBy` enum maps onto these columns: `pct` = % busy (default), `count` = method call count, `stateSize` = state size, `totalMs` = total ms, `name` = device/app name.

**hub_list_captured_states (list saved device-state snapshots):**
- Storage limit is configurable (default 20; `maxCapturedStates` setting). When the store is full, the oldest snapshot is auto-deleted to make room for a new capture.
- The response reports `maxLimit` (the retention cap) and, when near/at the cap, a `warning` field: "Approaching limit" within 4 slots of the cap, "At maximum capacity" once full (the next capture will evict the oldest).
- **Cursor pagination:** page size 50. Omit the cursor for an unbounded list; for paging pass an empty string for the first page and iterate `nextCursor`.

**hub_call_gc (force JVM garbage collection):**
- Returns free memory before and after GC in KB (`beforeFreeMemoryKB`, `afterFreeMemoryKB`).
- Reports the reclaimed amount as `deltaKB` plus a `memoryReclaimed` boolean (true when free memory increased); both are present only when both readings succeeded.

### hub_delete_debug_logs

Clears the MCP history view read by hub_get_logs(mode='mcp') using a durable clear marker, so old native entries do not return after reload. Hubitat system logs (hub_get_logs) and captured device states (hub_delete_captured_state) are unchanged. Use it before reproducing an issue.

### hub_report_issue

Rule routing: a legacy custom MCP rule-engine rule id goes in the `ruleId` param; a native Rule Machine rule/app goes in the `nativeAppId` param. They are different engines -- do not cross them (each scopes the report's logs to its own engine).


### hub_list_devices

**Response shapes & general behaviour.** Summary mode returns `currentStates`; detailed mode replaces that with `capabilities`, `attributes` (the device's REPORTED current states -- a declared-but-never-set attribute is absent, not unsupported), and `commands`. Attribute values keep the driver-declared type: `dataType: NUMBER` attributes are JSON numbers, everything else is a string, stable per attribute. `scope='all'` lists every hub device (not just MCP-authorized ones), each tagged with an `mcpAuthorized` flag (true/false). To count a parent's children, group the response by `parentDeviceId`.

**format='context' (the house-snapshot primitive).** One call answers "what's in this house and what state is it in": the `summary` field is a self-contained plain-text block -- a header (`Mode:`, `HSM:` when available, `Devices: N of M`) plus one line per device (`- Label (id, room) - Cap1, Cap2; attr=value, ...`). Attribute values carry the reported unit directly appended with no separator (`temperature=72.5°F`, `battery=87%`) -- parse on `=` accordingly -- and come from native fullJson state for each returned device. Filters that depend on device metadata or state read all candidates before pagination from ONE bulk hub read (never one native read per device). A device whose native metadata cannot be read is still listed with `metadataUnavailable: true`, is excluded from any active filter, is named in `metadataUnavailableIds`, and the response carries `partial: true` -- so one broken device never hides the rest. The default attribute set: switch/level/motion/contact/presence/lock/temperature/humidity/illuminance/battery/power/energy/thermostat fields/speed/position/valve/water/smoke. Page size defaults to 50 (set `limit` to change); `nextCursor` is always emitted when more devices remain, and the header repeats it. Structured fields (`mode`, `hsmStatus`, `count`, `total`, filter echoes) ride alongside the text. Combine with the filters below for scoped snapshots ("what's on in the Kitchen" = `roomFilter` + `onlyOn`). Ignores `fields`/`detailed`; not available with `scope='all'`.

- **attributeNames** -- format='context' only (rejected on every other format rather than silently ignored): replaces the default per-line attribute set with the named attributes, in caller order. An EMPTY array means the default set, not "no attributes" (same convention as `fields`). When an explicit projection matches no attribute on any returned line, the response carries `attributeNamesMatchedNoAttributes: true` -- the typo-vs-absence diagnostic (attribute names are camelCase, e.g. `temperature`, not `temp`).

**Filter ordering.** Server-side filtering via the `filter` / `labelFilter` / `capabilityFilter` / `roomFilter` / `onlyOn` / `changedSince` params is all applied *before* pagination (each is documented on its own parameter). Effective order: `filter` -> `labelFilter` -> `capabilityFilter` -> `roomFilter` -> `onlyOn` -> `changedSince` -> pagination.

- **filter** -- `stale:<hours>` example: `stale:24` = no activity in the last 24 hours; never-reported devices count as stale. `virtual` returns a *different* population and shape from the other filters, including driver namespace/type; it is not combinable with `roomFilter`/`onlyOn`/`changedSince`/`attributeNames` or `format='context'` (rejected rather than silently ignored).
- **labelFilter** -- applied after `filter`, before pagination.
- **capabilityFilter** -- applied after `labelFilter`, before pagination. When `count=0`, the response includes `capabilityFilterMatchedKnownCapability` to distinguish "no devices have this capability" from a typo.
- **roomFilter** -- case-insensitive EXACT match on the device's assigned room name. When the filtered total is 0, the response includes `roomFilterMatchedKnownRoom` to distinguish "room exists but matched nothing after earlier filters" from a typo. The diagnostic checks MCP-VISIBLE devices only -- a real hub room whose devices are all outside this app's authorized list reads `false`; list every hub room via hub_list_rooms.
- **onlyOn** -- `true` keeps only devices whose `switch` attribute currently reads `on`. `false` is a no-op (it does NOT mean "only off"). Devices without a switch attribute are excluded when active.
- **changedSince** -- keeps devices with `lastActivity` at/after the timestamp; the inverse of `filter='stale:<hours>'`. Accepts epoch milliseconds or ISO-8601 with a numeric offset in either spelling (`-0600` or `-06:00`; trailing `Z` accepted) -- offset-less (`2026-06-23T10:00:00`) and date-only forms are REJECTED. Same forms as hub_list_device_events' `since` (the two share one parser, so both accept either offset spelling), and a returned `lastActivity` value round-trips directly. Epoch-ms input echoes back as canonical ISO (the echo is always a string). Devices with no readable lastActivity are excluded (they can't prove they changed). Change-watching loop: snapshot a `lastActivity` (or the echoed `changedSince`), act, then pass it back to see exactly what changed.
- **format** -- `'detailed'` is the same as `detailed=true`; `detailed=true` overrides `format='summary'`.
- **fields** -- valid names: `id`, `name`, `label`, `room`, `disabled`, `deviceNetworkId`, `lastActivity`, `parentDeviceId`, `mcpManaged`, `currentStates`, `capabilities`, `attributes`, `commands`. Omitted or empty = all default fields for the active format. Ignored when `format='ids'`. `id` is always included regardless of projection (use `format='ids'` for id-only results). Including `capabilities`, `attributes`, or `commands` auto-promotes the response to detailed mode (those fields require detailed-mode device introspection).
- **cursor** -- `nextCursor` is returned alongside `nextOffset`.
- **scope** -- `'all'` returns EVERY device on the hub, each tagged `mcpAuthorized` true/false. Use it to find a device that exists on the hub but can't be controlled -- `mcpAuthorized` reflects current effective access: selection plus MCP-owned children when bypass is off, every device when bypass is on. With bypass off, `mcpAuthorized=false` means selection is required before ordinary device access. `scope='all'` records are lightweight (id/label/capabilities/mcpAuthorized only; no attributes/commands/currentStates) and support format `'summary'` or `'ids'`; `capabilityFilter` / `labelFilter` / pagination still apply. Three honesty flags ride both shapes: `capabilitiesPartial` + `capabilitiesNote` when capabilities could not be established for every record (an empty list may mean unknown); `capabilitiesUnavailableIds` (plus `capabilitiesUnavailable: true` on the summary record) naming authorized devices whose native capability read failed; and `idsComplete: false` (present only then) when the record SET itself could not be vouched for -- the hub's device tree could not be read, answered empty, or disagreed with the picker feed -- so branch on that field, not on the note's wording.

### hub_get_device

Use when you need a single device's complete profile — e.g. to discover which commands it supports and which attributes it has reported before calling hub_call_device_command or hub_get_device_attribute. Attributes are reported current states only (details mode says so via `attributeCoverage`): an attribute the driver declares but has never set is absent, not unsupported. For a multi-device listing use hub_list_devices instead.

Only query devices the user has mentioned or that are relevant to their request. Do not probe random devices.

### hub_get_device_attribute

Get a device attribute's current value, or block-poll until it reaches an expected value. Polls one device, or several at once via deviceIds.

One-shot read by default (deviceId + attribute). Provide expectedValue and/or expectedValues to block-poll until currentValue matches, returning immediately on match or when timeoutMs elapses.

A single round-trip that replaces N client-side reads + sleeps (verify a command took effect, wait for a sensor threshold, detect Z-Wave inclusion finished). comparator controls the match: eq (default, in-set), ne (not in-set), gt/gte/lt/lte (numeric threshold via expectedValue), between (numeric inclusive range via expectedValues [low, high]). stableForMs requires the condition to hold continuously for that many ms before converging (debounce). For MULTI-DEVICE convergence pass deviceIds (a list, mutually exclusive with deviceId, max 20) instead of deviceId: the same condition is applied to every device and mode controls the aggregate -- "all" (default) converges when every device matches, "any" on the first to match; the result is a compact per-device array (not full device objects) plus convergedCount. Poll mode BLOCKS up to timeoutMs (default 5000ms, max 60000ms) and queues concurrent MCP requests; prefer event-driven flows where possible. First read fires immediately; subsequent reads are spaced by pollIntervalMs.

Only query devices the user has mentioned or that are relevant to their request.

**Parameters:**

- **deviceId** (Device ID from hub_list_devices): Required for single-device mode; omit when using deviceIds. Provide exactly ONE of deviceId or deviceIds, not both.
- **deviceIds** (multi-device poll): Mutually exclusive with deviceId. The same condition (attribute + comparator + expectedValue(s) + stableForMs) is applied to every device; mode controls the aggregate (any/all). Max 20 devices, no duplicates. The result is a compact per-device array (deviceId/device/finalValue/matched, plus per-device neverReported/nonNumericAttribute on timeout) plus convergedCount -- not full device objects.
- **mode** (multi-device aggregate): Used with deviceIds. all (default) converges when EVERY device matches; any on the first to match. Rejected if passed with a single deviceId. Also drives stableForMs (the whole any/all condition must hold for the window).
- **attribute** (attribute name): The same attribute is read on every device in multi-device mode.
- **expectedValue**: For eq/ne it is one of the in-set values; for gt/gte/lt/lte it is the single numeric threshold (e.g. "72"). Provide exactly ONE of expectedValue or expectedValues, not both.
- **expectedValues**: For eq/ne it is the value set (OR semantics -- match any member); for between it is exactly two numeric bounds [low, high]. Provide exactly ONE of expectedValue or expectedValues, not both.
- **comparator** (default eq, value in the expected set): ne = NOT in the set. gt/gte/lt/lte = numeric compare against expectedValue. between = numeric inclusive low<=value<=high from expectedValues (exactly 2). Numeric comparators never match a null/non-numeric value (keep polling).
- **stableForMs** (debounce, default 0 = first match): Must be < timeoutMs. A value that flaps out of the condition restarts the window.
- **pollIntervalMs** (poll mode re-check interval, default 200): the TARGET cadence. Every tick costs one native read per device, and that latency is subtracted from the sleep so fast reads keep the requested spacing; the sleep never drops below half the interval, so slow reads (or many devices) space ticks by the reads plus that floor rather than saturating the hub. (hub_call_device_command's waitFor defaults to 250 instead: a post-command poll follows a write, so wider spacing reduces read contention.)

### hub_list_device_events
- Higher limits (50+) may slow the hub; default limit applies otherwise.

- `attribute` filters by event name. For a device it is an attribute (e.g. `switch`); for location-level events it accepts one of `mode`, `hsmStatus`, `hsmAlert`, or a hub-variable name.

### hub_get_compatible_devices

- Requires the Read master.
- Filter by brand, protocol (Zigbee|Z-Wave|Matter|LAN|...), deviceType, or a free-text query; paginated (cursor).
- Summaries by default; set `includeInstructions=true` (with a narrow filter) for the HTML-stripped step-by-step instructions.
- `brand` filter is a brand substring, e.g. 'Aeotec'.
- `protocol` filter is a protocol substring, e.g. 'Zigbee', 'Z-Wave', 'Matter', 'LAN'.
- `deviceType` filter is a device-type substring, e.g. 'Dimmer', 'Water Sensor'.
- `includeInstructions`: use with a narrow filter; pages are smaller in this mode.
- `cursor` page size: 40 (summary) / 12 (with instructions).

        builtin_app_tools: '''## Installed-App & Native-Rule Tools

Tools in the hub_read_apps_code and hub_manage_native_rules_and_apps gateways are gated by the two universal masters. The read tools (hub_list_apps any scope, hub_list_device_dependents, hub_get_app_config, hub_list_app_pages, hub_list_hpm_packages with optional includeDrift) require the Read master (ON by default). The hub_manage_native_rules_and_apps write tools require the Write master; the destructive CRUD tools (hub_set_rule / hub_set_native_app / hub_delete_native_app) ALSO require confirm=true + a recent backup (requireDestructiveConfirm). If the user sees "Read tools are disabled" or "Write tools are disabled" errors, direct them to the Read/Write toggles on the MCP Rule Server app settings page.

### hub_read_apps_code (4 tools)

- **hub_list_apps (scope='instances')** — enumerate ALL running app instances on the hub (built-in + user) with parent/child tree
  - filter="all" (default) | "builtin" | "user" | "disabled" | "parents" | "children"
  - Each entry: id, name, type, disabled, user, hidden, parentId, hasChildren, childCount
  - Built-in apps have user=false (Rule Machine, Room Lighting, Groups and Scenes, Mode Manager, HSM, Dashboards, Maker API, etc.)
  - User apps have user=true (Awair, Ecobee, HPM, etc.)
  - Parent/child tree is flattened with parentId pointers. Hidden parents are excluded from output but their children are promoted to the nearest visible ancestor.

- **hub_list_device_dependents** — find apps that reference a specific device
  - Use BEFORE deleting a device, disabling a device, or troubleshooting unexpected behavior
  - Returns appsUsing array with each app's id, name (type like "Room Lights" or "Rule-5.1"), label (user-visible), trueLabel (HTML-stripped), disabled
  - Answers "if I delete this device, which automations break?"

- **hub_get_app_config** — read an installed app's configuration page (Read master required)
  - Returns app identity (label, type, disabled), config page sections/inputs/values, and child apps
  - summary=true is a fast identity-only mode: the hub's thin app record (id, name, type, disabled, user) with no config-page render -- use it for existence/identity checks on expensive apps
  - Multi-page apps expose sub-pages via pageName. For HPM: use pageName="prefPkgUninstall" for the FULL installed-package list; pageName="prefPkgModify" returns only the subset with optional components; pageName="prefOptions" is the main-menu navigation (no package data). RM 5.x and Room Lighting use a single mainPage (no pageName needed). Call hub_list_app_pages first to discover available page names for any multi-page app.
  - includeSettings=true adds the raw internal settings map (large apps: 500-1000 keys with app-specific encoding)
  - projection="ruleStructure" selects the read-only `hubitat.rm.structure` v1 contract: named required expression/triggers, compiled actionList order, individual compiled description fields and non-string local metadata. It rejects pageName/summary/includeSettings combinations; no arbitrary settings or local values are returned. Missing source fields are explicit gaps. See docs/rule-structure.md.
  - Workflow: hub_list_apps (scope='instances'; or hub_list_rules for RM rules specifically -- note that hub_get_custom_rule handles only MCP-native rules, not Hubitat's built-in Rule Machine) to find appId, then hub_get_app_config to inspect. For multi-page apps, consider hub_list_app_pages first.

- **hub_list_app_pages** — discover what pageNames a given app accepts (Read master required)
  - Input: appId
  - Returns curated page directory for known app types (HPM, RM 5.x, Room Lighting, Mode Manager) plus an introspected primary page for unknown app types
  - Cuts the page-name guessing cycle for multi-page apps. Especially useful for HPM which exposes multiple sub-pages (prefPkgUninstall / prefPkgModify / prefPkgInstall / prefPkgMatchUp) for different operations.

### hub_read_apps_code (2 tools) — HPM package state introspection (Read master required)

- **hub_list_hpm_packages** — return all packages tracked by Hubitat Package Manager with full component inventory
  - If hpmAppId is omitted, HPM is auto-discovered by scanning installed apps for type="Hubitat Package Manager"
  - Each package: manifestUrl, packageName, version, beta, author, apps[], drivers[], files[]
  - Each app/driver component: id (UUID), name, heID (Hubitat code ID or null), required, version
  - files[] entries have no heID (File Manager assets tracked by name only)

- **hub_list_hpm_packages with includeDrift=true** — also cross-reference HPM tracked state against what is installed on the hub (attached under a `drift` key)
  - Surfaces missing-required (required=true but heID null), orphan-app (heID recorded but code no longer in Apps Code registry), and orphan-driver (heID recorded but code no longer in Drivers Code registry) signals
  - Optional packageFilter (case-insensitive substring) narrows to specific packages
  - Response: packagesChecked, packagesWithActionableDrift (packages with at least one actionable signal), totalDriftSignals (actionable drift only -- not data-quality warnings), drift[] array (one entry per package with signals or dataQualityWarnings; drift[].length may exceed packagesWithActionableDrift when data-quality-only packages exist), summary sentence, orphanDetection ({enabled, reason?}), orphanDriverDetection ({enabled, reason?}), limitations note
  - Data-quality warning types in dataQualityWarnings[]: heid-whitespace-normalized (padded heID normalized; component KEPT), heid-non-scalar-dropped (non-scalar heID; component DROPPED), empty-heid, skipped-malformed-component
  - Limitation: heID-presence-only; HPM stores no source hashes so post-install edits via hub_update_app are not detectable

### hub_manage_native_rules_and_apps (11 tools) — read, trigger, AND full CRUD on native RM rules

RMUtils-based control surface (hub_list_rules = Read master; trigger/pause/private-boolean = Write master):
- **hub_list_rules** — enumerate Rule Machine rules (RM 4.x + 5.x combined, deduplicated by id). Each rule carries a live **status** — "active" | "paused" | "stopped" | "disabled" | "unknown" — plus **disabled** / **paused** booleans (omitted on the "unknown" path) and, only when detected, **requiredExpressionFalse: true**.
  - **disabled** is the app's red-X enable/disable flag, read straight from /hub2/appsList (data.disabled).
  - **paused** is decoration-detected. Rule Machine surfaces a paused rule ONLY as a "(Paused)" suffix appended to the app's /hub2/appsList name; the RMUtils label for the same rule stays clean (live-verified). So the appsList name and the RMUtils label are BOTH HTML-stripped (tags removed, entities decoded, trimmed — the appsList name comes decoded, the RMUtils label comes entity-escaped like "Heat On &lt;67" and can carry trailing spaces) and diffed: equal → no decoration; appsList == label + remainder → the remainder is the decoration ("(Paused)" ⇒ paused, "(Required Expression false)" ⇒ requiredExpressionFalse). A rule the user literally NAMED "... (Paused)" is NOT false-flagged: the RMUtils label carries the same suffix, so the remainder is empty.
  - **stopped** is the runtime "(Stopped)" decoration after hub_call_rule(action="stop"), detected by the SAME appsList-vs-RMUtils-label diff the paused check uses (a rule literally NAMED "... (Stopped)" carries the suffix in both strings, so it is not false-flagged). The suffix is stripped from the returned label/name in the encoding they already use; hub_call_rule(action="start") removes it. CAVEAT: this decoration appears here only when the hub's list source decorates the label, which many firmwares do NOT do -- the authoritative stopped check is hub_get_rule_health's `stopped` field, which prefers explicit statusJson state and falls back to config-page markup when state is unavailable.
  - **precedence** governs only the **status** summary (disabled > stopped > paused > active). The disabled/paused booleans are independent facts: a rule paused first and red-X disabled afterward keeps its "(Paused)" decoration, so it truthfully reads disabled:true AND paused:true with status:"disabled".
  - **status "unknown"** is per-rule, not just per-list. Tree-level: /hub2/appsList was momentarily unreadable, so NO rule has data — the whole list is returned unfiltered (post-delete ghosts may linger) with a result-level **statusNote**. Per-entry: the tree read fine but ONE rule's node is under-populated (data.disabled absent, node name null, or the RMUtils label null), so just THAT rule is "unknown" while the rest keep real statuses. Either way the disabled/paused booleans are omitted (a value the data can't support is never asserted).
  - This status detection covers Rule Machine rules. For the enabled/disabled state of other classic automation apps (Room Lighting, Notifier, Basic Rules, Button Controllers) use hub_list_apps (scope='instances'), whose entries carry a disabled flag.
- **hub_call_rule** — trigger one or more RM rules (ruleId takes an id or an array; rule/actions dispatch the whole set in one RMUtils call, stop/start toggle per rule with per-rule results + failedRuleIds/remainingRuleIds on partial batches)
  - action="rule" (default): full evaluation (triggers + conditions + actions)
  - action="actions": run actions only, skip conditions
  - action="stop": stop running actions
  - action="start": restart a stopped rule (re-initializes; resets private boolean)
- **hub_set_rule_paused** — pause (paused=true) or resume (paused=false) one or more rules in ONE call (ruleId takes an id or an array; multi-id batches existence-check every id first); reversible
- **hub_set_rule_private_boolean** — set the private boolean of one or more rules (ruleId takes an id or an array; Boolean or lowercase "true"/"false" only)

Native CRUD (hub admin-layer, additionally requires the Write master):
- **hub_set_native_app** — create or edit any classic SmartApp (Button Controller, Notifier, Groups+Scenes, Basic Rules; edits Visual Rules by appId too). Omit appId to create (appType enum: rule_machine / button_controller / groups_scenes / notifier / basic_rule; name); provide appId to edit via settings/button. Visual Rules are created with hub_set_visual_rule, not this appType enum. Create a Button Rule under its controller via buttonRule={controllerId, buttonNumber, event} (returns buttonRuleId; author its actions via hub_set_rule). walkStep (generic classic-page walker) works here too. Returns appId on create. (In the hub_manage_native_rules_and_apps gateway.)
- **hub_set_rule** — create or edit a Rule Machine rule. Omit appId to create (name; optionally bundle addTriggers=[...] / addActions=[...] to populate in one call); provide appId to edit via the structured shortcuts (addTrigger / addAction / addRequiredExpression / walkStep / ...). (In the hub_manage_rule_machine gateway.)
- **hub_set_rule** (edit detail) — edit an existing Rule Machine rule (appId required). Two raw modes (settings (Map) OR button (String)) plus 17 structured shortcuts (addTrigger, addTriggers, addAction, addActions, addRequiredExpression, replaceRequiredExpression, addLocalVariable, removeLocalVariable, removeAction, clearActions, replaceActions, moveAction, removeTrigger, modifyTrigger, modifyAction, patches, walkStep). Args: appId + one of those shortcut keys, plus optional pageName, stateAttribute, confirm. Auto-backs-up before writing; emits the multiple=true 3-field capability contract automatically. removeTrigger={index:N} deletes a trigger; modifyTrigger={index:N, mods:{state:'...'}} changes the state field of an existing trigger (capability/deviceIds changes require removeTrigger + addTrigger). modifyAction={index:N, mods:{ruleIds:[...]}} retargets a rule-targeting action (runRule/cancelTimers/pauseRule/privateBoolean; pauseRule also mods.action, privateBoolean also mods.value) via position-preserving rebuild -- the action's settings index changes, its position doesn't; other action shapes need removeAction + addAction. CAVEATS (verified live, fw 2.5.1.135): RM silently no-ops delete-class wizard clicks on a DISABLED app, so editing a staged-disabled clone means enable -> modifyAction -> re-disable; and a '(Not Installed)' Button Rule child (no actions yet) rejects those clicks even when enabled -- author its first action before retargeting.
- **hub_set_app_disabled** — enable or disable any installed app (red-X) via POST /installedapp/disable; reversible. Args: appId, disabled (bool). Read-back verified.
- **hub_delete_native_app** — soft delete (default; refuses if children exist) or force=true. Args: appId, force, confirm. Auto-backs-up before deleting.
- **hub_clone_native_app** — clone any classic SmartApp via Hubitat's first-party appCloner (deep: child apps and pause state copy, so a clone of an ACTIVE app lands ACTIVE). Args: sourceAppId, newName (opt), stageDisabled (opt: disable the clone + every descendant immediately; a staging failure returns success:false with per-app stageFailures -- do NOT re-clone, the app exists), confirm. Returns newAppId. Drives the appCloner's 4-step wizard (cloneRuleButton -> confirmation -> importRule sub-page -> importNow); typical clones complete in tens of seconds.
- **hub_export_native_app** — export any classic SmartApp to its canonical JSON shape via Hubitat's first-party appCloner. Args: sourceAppId, saveAs (opt File Manager filename). Returns jsonContent. Self-contained document with appReplacements + deviceReplacements + full rule state; round-trips through hub_import_native_app.
- **hub_import_native_app** — re-create a rule/app from a previously-exported JSON via Hubitat's first-party appCloner (the import lands ACTIVE). Args: jsonContent | fromFile, parentHintAppId, newName (opt), stageDisabled (opt: disable the import + every descendant immediately; failure contract as on clone), confirm. Returns newAppId. The cloner needs an existing rule under the target parent to seed itself (parentHintAppId).

- Clone/import require a readable parent child-app snapshot before creation; a refusal says nothing was created and can be retried after restoring access. Discovery never guesses among ambiguous new children. If modern staging reaches its continuation limit, the terminal error retains newAppId, stagedDisabled, stageFailures and stageRemaining from the last slice. Disable the remaining/failed apps directly; do not repeat creation.
- **hub_get_rule_health** — read-only health check on any installed app (Rule Machine AND Visual Rules Builder). Args: appId, source (auto|ruleBuilderJson|configPage, default auto). Prefers the compiled-state verdict: the classic RM `broken` boolean (/app/ruleBuilderJson) or a graph Visual Rule's validationErrors (/app/ruleBuilder20Json); for classic RM the HTML render scan is retained as cross-check + fallback. Returns ok / broken / source / ruleFormat / label / paused / stopped / configPageError / brokenMarkers / multipleFlagPoison / structuralIssues / orphanedActionRows (leftover actType/actSubType rows that are not among the rule's actions -- diagnostic only, never affects ok) / validationErrors / issues (+ predicate when read). Pause state comes from the rule's compiled Boolean or status state; tagged runtime decoration is a fallback. `paused:null` means unknown. Explicit stopped state outranks config-page markup. Literal `(Paused)` and `(Stopped)` name suffixes are preserved; Visual Rule labels come from their own document unless configPage is forced. Embedded write-response health carries compiled paused only; the standalone read adds status/markup fallbacks, stopped, and live subscription/job counts.

For READING an RM rule's current state, use **hub_get_app_config** in the hub_read_apps_code gateway — it works on any installed app including RM rules and returns the same configPage shape that hub_set_rule expects to see.

For BACKUP enumeration and restore, use the unified **hub_list_backups** (in hub_read_apps_code) + **hub_restore_backup** (in hub_manage_backup) — RM rule snapshots have type="rm-rule" in those tools' output and hub_restore_backup auto-dispatches the rule-restore path.

### Safety model for native CRUD
1. Every existing-app edit has a full File Manager rollback baseline (configure/json + statusJson); by default, edits to the same app reuse the newest baseline for one hour. The response's backup.backupKey is the restore handle, and restoring a reused baseline undoes every edit made after it. Deletes and destructive Required Expression replacement always take a fresh snapshot.
2. Multi-device capability inputs (capability.X with multiple=true) require a 3-field POST payload group (settings[name]=csv, name.type=capability.X, name.multiple=true). Omitting name.multiple=true poisons the AppSetting DB flag and every render throws `Command 'size' is not supported by device`. hub_set_rule emits the full group automatically from the input schema — callers never have to think about this.
3. After every write, the multiple flags in the live appSettings are verified. If any flipped, one automatic retry fires with the full group. Persistent divergence throws and the response surfaces hub_restore_backup as the next step.
4. delete is soft by default. Pass force=true only when you know the rule has children you also want gone.

### CRUD workflow example
  hub_set_rule(name="BAT-RM-demo", confirm=true) → {appId: 974, ...}
  hub_get_app_config(appId=974, includeSettings=true) → input schema + current settings
  hub_set_rule(appId=974, addTrigger={capability: "Switch", deviceIds: [8, 9], state: "on"}, confirm=true)
  hub_set_rule(appId=974, addAction={capability: "switch", action: "off", deviceIds: [10]}, confirm=true)
  hub_get_rule_health(appId=974) → verify ok=true, no configPageError or brokenMarkers
  hub_delete_native_app(appId=974, force=true, confirm=true) → {backup: {backupKey: "rm-rule_974_..."}}

### hub_get_app_config (deferred internals: embeddedActions wire-format + includeSettings key encoding)

- **embeddedActions in RM 5.1**: the clickable wizard buttons (e.g. RM's Create/Edit/Delete Trigger) are exposed by the hub as `<div class='submitOnChange'>` elements, NOT as schema inputs. The `embeddedActions` field surfaces each button's `name` plus its `stateAttribute` so that `hub_set_rule` can drive the button.
- **includeSettings raw-key encoding example**: large apps' raw app-internal settings keys use app-specific encoding — e.g. Room Lighting encodes per-device-per-scene keys as `dm~<deviceId>~<scene>`. (Set `includeSettings=true` only for power-user inspection; large apps can have 500-1000 such keys.)

### hub_list_apps (scope='instances' filter — category meanings)

The `filter` enum values select which category of instances to return (scope='instances' only):
- **all** (default) — every instance
- **builtin** — Hubitat native apps
- **user** — custom Groovy apps
- **disabled** — paused apps
- **parents** — apps with children, e.g. Rule Machine, Room Lighting
- **children** — individual rules, scenes

### hub_list_drivers (list device driver TYPES on the hub)

`include='user'` (default) lists user-installed drivers only; `include='all'` returns the full catalog (system + virtual + user), where each entry is `{id, name, namespace, bucket}` per driver type.

- For `include='all'`, each entry is tagged `bucket=system|virtual|user`.
- For an `include='all'` entry, its **id** is the driver-type id to pass to `hub_create_device`, while `hub_manage_virtual_device(customDriver={namespace, name})` takes that same entry's **namespace + name** (not the id).


### hub_list_app_pages (curated page-name directory)

Curated sub-page directories by app type: HPM — prefOptions (main menu), prefPkgUninstall (full installed-package list), prefPkgModify (modifiable subset), prefPkgInstall (install flow), prefPkgMatchUp (match-up flow); Rule Machine rules — mainPage only (rules are single-page); Room Lighting — mainPage; Mode Manager — mainPage. Unknown app types return the live primary page only.


### hub_call_rule

`action` selects which Rule Machine verb to invoke (default `rule`):

- **`rule`** → `runRule`: re-evaluate the rule's conditions, then run the matching true/false action set.
- **`actions`** → `runRuleAct`: run the action list directly, skipping condition evaluation.
- **`stop`**: halt the rule's in-progress actions.
- **`start`**: re-enable a stopped rule (also resets its private boolean).

`stop`/`start` toggle the stopRule UI button, not RMUtils (RMUtils has no startRule verb).

### hub_set_native_app

This is the generic upsert tool for ANY classic SmartApp. It is separate from the MCP custom rule engine (`hub_*_custom_rule`), and Rule Machine RULES belong in `hub_set_rule` (use this tool only for non-RM classic apps).

**Create path (admin-layer shell).** A new app's shell is created via the hub's admin-layer `createchild` endpoint, which bypasses the SmartApp parent-type check that blocks third-party `addChildApp('hubitat', ...)` calls. The new app then appears under Apps / Automations exactly as if created via the native UI. The creatable `appType` enum is driven by `_appTypeRegistry()` — add new creatable types there.

**`name`** — the label for the new app; it is shown in the hub's app list.

**Button Rules.** A Button Rule cannot be created standalone and is NOT an `appType` value — create it via the `buttonRule` parameter (`buttonRule={controllerId, buttonNumber, event}`). It routes through the controller's add-button flow and returns `buttonRuleId` with the Button trigger auto-seeded; author its actions via `hub_set_rule(appId=buttonRuleId, addAction=...)`. The controller must already have a button device assigned.

**RM authoring shortcuts and `walkStep` are EDIT-only here.** `walkStep` and the RM authoring shortcuts also work on this tool, but ONLY on EDIT (appId present) for RM-wire-format classic apps; the CREATE arm (no appId) honors NONE of them and rejects rather than silently dropping them. `walkStep` has the same shape as `hub_set_rule`'s `walkStep` — see `hub_get_tool_guide(section='set_rule_reference_walkstep')`. For Rule Machine RULES use `hub_set_rule`.

**Edit backups.** Existing-app edits ensure a File Manager baseline exists. By default the newest baseline for the same app is reused for one hour; restoring it undoes every later edit in that chain. Enable **Back up before every native app edit** under Advanced settings for a fresh snapshot on every edit. Deletes and destructive Required Expression replacement always take a fresh snapshot.

**CREATE is limited to the 5 enum `appType`s** (`rule_machine` / `button_controller` / `groups_scenes` / `notifier` / `basic_rule`). Other classic apps (e.g. Room Lighting, Scenes) are EDIT/DELETE-only via `appId` — there is NO create path for them here.

### hub_get_rule_health

Rule Machine, Visual Rules Builder, and the other supported classic apps (Button Controller, Basic Rule) share RM's configPage protocol.

`ruleFormat` says which engine answered: `rm` / `vrb-graph` / `vrb-classic` / `basic-rule` / `button-controller` / `classic-app`.

The report surfaces the compiled-state broken verdict, validationErrors, config-page render errors, RM `*BROKEN*` / `**Broken Trigger|Action|Condition**` markers, multiple-flag corruption, structural IF/Repeat imbalance, and a compiled-vs-HTML cross-check.

**`source` parameter — which source(s) to read:**
- `auto` (default): the preferred compiled-state verdict plus the RM HTML render detections + a cross-check.
- `ruleBuilderJson`: the compiled-state verdict only.
- `configPage`: the legacy RM HTML render scan only.

### hub_list_rule_local_variables

List a Rule Machine rule's LOCAL variables (per-rule, distinct from hub globals). Requires the Read master.

- Hub globals are covered by `hub_list_variables`; locals are created via `hub_set_rule` `addLocalVariable` / `removeLocalVariable`.
- Reads `state.allLocalVars` from the rule's `statusJson` appState; returns each local's name, type, and current value.
- Pure read -- no wizard, no mutation.
- Use to confirm a local exists (and its type) before targeting it with the `setLocalVariable` action or `removeLocalVariable` shortcut.

### hub_delete_native_app

The `force` flag selects which hub admin-layer endpoint performs the delete:

- **force=false (default)** — soft delete via `/installedapp/delete`. The hub refuses if the app has child apps or devices; the response includes `hubMessage` explaining why.
- **force=true** — hard delete via `/installedapp/forcedelete/quiet` — the same path the hub UI uses internally for its own "Delete" buttons. No child safety checks.


### hub_list_hpm_packages

**Component inventory detail (per app/driver component):**
- `heID` (Hubitat's internal code ID) is null when the component was never installed OR was removed outside HPM.
- Per-component `version` is present only if the manifest author included one -- many manifests do not.
- **heID normalization, recorded via a per-entry `_warning` field on the component:**
  - An empty/whitespace-only heID string -> heID is cleared to null and a `_warning` field is added to that entry (e.g. `"empty heID string '' normalized to null"`).
  - A whitespace-padded heID (e.g. `' 142 '`) -> trimmed, heID stays non-null, and `_warning` records the normalization.
  - A non-scalar heID (not a Number or String) -> cleared to null with a `_warning`.

**Response fields (beyond `packages[]`):**
- `count` -- packages returned.
- `hpmAppId` -- HPM's installed-app ID, echoed so callers can cache it and skip discovery.
- `skippedMalformed` -- manifest URLs whose top-level value was not a Map (the package is skipped).
- per-package `skippedAppCount` / `skippedDriverCount` / `skippedFileCount` -- non-Map component entries skipped; each field is omitted when 0.

**Errors (all surface as `isError: true` validation results):**
- Multiple HPM instances -> `IllegalArgumentException` listing up to 10 instance IDs with `"and N more (total M)"`.
- `hpmAppId` pointing at a non-HPM app -> `IllegalArgumentException` disclosing the actual app type.

**Drift mode (`includeDrift=true`):** off by default; enabling it adds 1-2 hub calls.

**Cursor pagination:** page size 25. Each package entry carries its full app/driver/file inventory, so individual entries can be large.

### hub_list_device_dependents

Referencing app types it can surface include: Room Lighting instances, Rule Machine rules, Groups and Scenes, Mode Manager, dashboards, Maker API, and the Echo Skill.

### hub_clone_native_app

- Preserves the full rule shape (conditions, expressions, IF/THEN/ELSE structure).
- A lower-overhead alternative to rebuilding via the wizard: clone an existing rule that already has the shape you want, then adjust the copy.
- `newName` defaults to `<source-label> clone` when omitted.

### hub_export_native_app

Exports to the same JSON format Hubitat's UI Export button produces. Three use cases:
- Backup before risky edits.
- Edit-as-text: materialize a rule to JSON, mutate it, then re-import as a new rule via hub_import_native_app.
- Hub-to-hub transfer.

`saveAs` writes the JSON to File Manager (e.g. for HPM-style distribution). Export instantiates a cloner app and persists it, so it counts as a write.

### hub_import_native_app

- Pair with hub_export_native_app for backup/restore workflows.
- `parentHintAppId` seeds the cloner instance from an existing rule under the target parent (e.g. another RM rule for an RM import). It has no semantic effect on the imported rule beyond placing it under the same parent.
''',

        set_rule_reference: '''## `hub_set_rule` capability reference

Reference for the `hub_set_rule` structured shortcuts (`addTrigger`, `addAction`, `addRequiredExpression`), the lower-level `walkStep` walker, and the raw `settings`/`button` wizard flow. The tool's schema descriptions point here so BOTH the flat and gateway `tools/list` catalogs stay lean (issue #181) without losing this reference. Get this whole section back inline at call time with `hub_set_rule(guide: true)` (no separate tool call), or pass `{discover: true}` on `addTrigger`/`addAction` for the live machine-readable schema.

To READ a rule's current configuration -- before an edit to discover the right input names, or to verify after a write -- use `hub_read_apps_code -> hub_get_app_config(appId)`. It is NOT in the `hub_manage_rule_machine` / `hub_manage_native_rules_and_apps` rule gateways; the rule-read tool lives in `hub_read_apps_code`.

Each edit response includes the File Manager baseline under `backup.backupKey`. By default the newest same-rule baseline is reused for one hour, so a sequence of small edits does not upload the same rule before every call. Restoring it returns the rule to the baseline timestamp and undoes every later edit in that chain. Enable **Back up before every native app edit** under Advanced settings for strict per-write snapshots. Deletes and destructive Required Expression replacement remain fresh regardless.

### `addTrigger` capability families

- **Device-state** (Switch / Motion / Contact / Lock / Garage / Door / Valve / Window Shade / Presence / Power source): `capability`, `deviceIds`, `state` (`'on'`, `'active'`, `'open'`, `'unlocked'`, etc.). To fire on ANY change of the attribute (not one specific value) pass `comparator:'*changed*'` and OMIT `state`: a device-state trigger has no separate comparator field, so the change token rides the value picker (`tstate<N>`) and renders e.g. "Switch changed". A bare change token in `state` (`state:'changed'`) is rejected fail-loud, steering you to `comparator:'*changed*'`.
- **Multi-device "all of these"**: add `allOfThese=true` to the device-state spec
- **Numeric** (Temperature / Humidity / Battery / Illuminance / Power / Energy / CO2 / Dimmer / Thermostat setpoints): `capability`, `deviceIds`, `comparator` (`=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `*changed*`), `value`
- **Button** (`capability='Button'`): `deviceIds`, `buttonNumber`, `state` (`pushed` | `held` | `doubleTapped` | `released`)
- **Custom Attribute** (`capability='Custom Attribute'`): `deviceIds`, `attribute` (the attribute name), `comparator`, `value`
- **And-stays sticky modifier** (any device-state or numeric trigger): add `andStays={hours, minutes, seconds}` to the spec
- **Time / Sunrise / Sunset** (`capability='Certain Time (and optional date)'`): `time` (`'A specific time'` | `'Sunrise'` | `'Sunset'`), `atTime`, `offset` (minutes, for sunrise/sunset)
  - `atTime` semantic: `'HH:mm'` form (e.g. `'17:00'`) = **DAILY-recurring** trigger that fires every day at that wall-clock time. Full ISO datetime (e.g. `'2026-04-29T17:00:00'` or `'2026-04-29T17:00:00.000-0500'`) = **ONE-SHOT dated** trigger that fires once on that specific date. Forms without timezone are auto-normalized to hub local tz; explicit-offset and Zulu forms are normalized to UTC equivalent.
- **Mode** (`capability='Mode'`): `state='Night'` OR `state=['Away','Night']` (mode names, case-insensitive) OR `modeIds=['3']` OR `modeIds=['3','5']` (IDs directly, from `hub_list_modes`).
  - **IMPORTANT:** writes `modesX<N>` internally — do NOT pass `tstate` or `rawSettings.tstate` for Mode triggers (silently ignored; renders as Broken Trigger). Use `hub_list_modes` to list valid mode names/IDs.
- **Periodic Schedule** (`capability='Periodic Schedule'`): recurring schedule via the dedicated periodic sub-page. Spec:
  ```
  periodic={
    frequency: 'Seconds'|'Minutes'|'Hourly'|'Daily'|'Weekly'|'Monthly'|'Yearly'|'Cron String',
    everyN: <int>,                 // "every N <unit>" mode (Seconds/Minutes/Hourly/Daily)
                                   //   REQUIRED even when =1 for Daily AND Hourly (omitting renders null)
                                   //   Seconds/Minutes: whole number from [1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30] (firmware-imposed; Hourly/Daily accept any positive integer; fractional truncates, 5.5->5)
    startingTime: 'HH:mm',         // start-time (Hourly/Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Yearly; Seconds has none); for Hourly-everyN, pass it (omitting renders a cosmetic trailing "starting at " blank)
    weekdaysOnly: <bool>,          // Daily-only
    selectedHours: [9,12],         // Hourly-only, alternative to everyN
    selectedMinutes: [0,30],       // Minutes-only, "at specific minutes", alternative to everyN
    selectedDaysOfMonth: [1,15],   // Daily-only, alternative to everyN/weekdays
    daysOfWeek: ['Monday','Friday'], // Weekly-only, MULTI day-of-week
    dayOfWeek: 'Monday',           // Monthly/Yearly nth-weekday, SINGLE day-of-week (distinct from daysOfWeek)
    dayOfMonth: <int>,             // Monthly by-day "on day number" (pair with everyNMonths; exclusive with weekOfMonth)
    everyNMonths: <int>,           // "of every N months" (Monthly, both modes; free integer)
    months: 'December',            // Yearly only -- single nth-weekday month (String); Monthly does NOT take months
    weekOfMonth: 'First',          // Monthly/Yearly nth-weekday: First|Second|Third|Fourth|Last (presence selects nth-weekday)
    minutesOffset: <int>,          // Hourly-only, when not using everyN (startingHCX<n>)
    cronString: '0 * * * *',       // Cron String mode
    rawSettings: {…}               // escape hatch for periodic-page fields not yet mapped
  }
  ```
  Monthly has TWO mutually-exclusive modes: by-day (`dayOfMonth` + `everyNMonths` -- BOTH required or renders null) and nth-weekday (`weekOfMonth` + `dayOfWeek` + `everyNMonths`). Passing both `dayOfMonth` and `weekOfMonth` is rejected. Monthly "specific months" ("on day N of selected months") is NOT yet supported (an order-sensitive third sub-mode) -- use `rawSettings`. Yearly is ALWAYS nth-weekday (`weekOfMonth` + `dayOfWeek` + single `months`) because RM 5.1 exposes no by-day calendar-day field for Yearly -- only the nth-weekday picker. A `Periodic Schedule` with no `periodic` map is rejected up front (`success=false`, naming any stray top-level keys) rather than committing a phantom `?` row. The tool walks the periodic sub-page (`whichPeriod<N>` → `everyN`/select → time → Done, where `<N>` is the per-trigger sub-page index) so the trigger description bakes correctly. Seconds/Minutes `everyN` outside the restricted enum (and Monthly dayOfMonth+weekOfMonth) is rejected with `success=false` and a structured error.

### Fail-loud `addTrigger` shape guards

Both reject before any hub write, returning `success=false` with a structured error rather than committing a broken trigger: (1) a state-change token supplied as `state` with no `comparator` (e.g. `state:'changed'`/`'increased'` on a device-state or numeric trigger) is rejected and steered to `comparator:'*changed*'`; **Mode / Variable / Custom Attribute are exempt** because their `state` legitimately carries a mode name or an enum value. (2) A `Periodic Schedule` with no `periodic` map is rejected, naming the stray top-level keys you passed instead.

### Fail-loud `addAction` shape guards

Both reject before any hub write -- "RM is not touched": (1) a condition-bearing action subtype (`ifThen`/`elseIf`/`repeatWhile`/`waitExpression`, matched irrespective of letter casing) passed a flat top-level `conditions` array is rejected and steered to the `expression` wrapper (`conditions:[...]` plus `operator`|`operators`); (2) an action-driven capability (any capability whose action schema exposes an `action` enum -- switch/dimmer/color/colorTemp/lock/shade/fan/button/..., plus the `Window Shade` display name) passed a trigger-style `state:` instead of `action:` is rejected and steered to `action:`.

### Did-you-mean on unknown capability names

when `addTrigger` (or an `addRequiredExpression` / `ifThen` / `waitEvents` condition) capability name is not in the live picker's option list, the fail-loud error appends a closest-match suggestion drawn from that same list (so the suggested name is one the picker actually accepts).

### Comma-joined mode steer

a mode passed as a single comma-joined string (`state:'Day,Evening'`) is looked up as one nonexistent mode; the unknown-mode error steers to the list shape (`state:['Day','Evening']`) instead of an opaque "unknown mode". Applies across the trigger Mode path, per-mode actions, the `mode` action, and Mode conditions.

### Condition-only rejects

a `*changed*`/`*became*` state-change comparator on a device-state CONDITION capability (with no explicit value) is rejected on every condition surface (`addTrigger.condition`, `addRequiredExpression`, `ifThen`) and steered to a trigger row -- conditions are point-in-time, so a change comparator has no meaning there. The date/day-window condition capabilities (`Between two dates`, `Days of week`, `On a Day`) are unmodelled on every structured condition surface and are rejected up front, steering to `rawSettings`/`walkStep`.

### `addAction` capability families

For the live machine-readable per-field schema (action enums, required and optional fields), pass `addAction: {discover: true}`. The repo-side `docs/rm_action_subtype_schemas.md` is a human-readable copy of the same content generated from `_rmActionSchemaForDiscover()`; it is not fetchable from the hub.

- **Switch** (`capability='switch'`): `action='on'`/`'off'`/`'toggle'`/`'flash'` + `deviceIds`. `action='setPerMode' + deviceIds + perMode={modeIdOrName: 'on'|'off', ...}`. `action='choosePerMode' + perMode={modeIdOrName: {on: [devIds], off: [devIds]}, ...}`. Optional `onlyOn` (Boolean, on/off only): RM's "command only switches that are on?" toggle -- when true the command reaches ONLY switches currently ON (off skips already-off; on is a no-op refresh).
  - **NOTE:** `action='flash'` starts a flash schedule on devices that support `.flash()` (Hue groups, many Z-Wave/Zigbee dimmer modules). RM 5.1 has NO native "stop flash" action subtype — calling `switch.on`/`.off` afterward does NOT cancel the flash schedule. To stop a running flash from within a rule, use `capability='runCommand'` with `command='flashOff'` on the same device list.
- **Dimmer** (`capability='dimmer'`):
  - `setLevel` + `deviceIds` + `level` (0–100) [required] + optional `fadeSeconds`
  - `toggle` + `deviceIds` + `level` (0–100) [required — the level to set when toggling from off to on] + optional `fadeSeconds`
  - `adjust` + `deviceIds` + `adjustBy` (-100..100) [required] + optional `fadeSeconds`
  - `fade` + `deviceIds` + `targetLevel` [required] + `minutes` [required] + `direction='raise'|'lower'` + optional `intervalSeconds`
  - `stopFade` (no fields)
  - `startRaiseLower` + `deviceIds` + `direction='raise'|'lower'`
  - `stopChanging` + `deviceIds`
  - `setLevelPerMode` + `deviceIds` + `perMode={modeIdOrName: level, ...}` + optional `fadeSeconds`
- **Color** (`capability='color'`, RGBW bulbs):
  - `setColor` + `deviceIds` + `colorName` + optional `level`
  - `toggleColor` + `deviceIds` + `colorName` + optional `level`
  - `setColorPerMode` + `deviceIds` + `perMode={modeIdOrName: {color: 'Red', level: 70}, ...}`
- **Color Temperature** (`capability='colorTemp'`):
  - `setColorTemp` + `deviceIds` + `kelvin` + optional `level`
  - `toggleColorTemp` + `deviceIds` + `kelvin` + optional `level`
  - `fadeColorTemp` + `deviceIds` + `targetKelvin` + `minutes` + `direction='raise'|'lower'`
  - `stopColorTempFade` (no fields)
  - `setColorTempPerMode` + `deviceIds` + `perMode={modeIdOrName: {kelvin: 2700, level: 70}, ...}`
- **Button** (`capability='button'`, pushable-button devices): `push` + `deviceIds` + `buttonNumber`. `pushPerMode` + `deviceIds` + `perMode={modeIdOrName: buttonNumber, ...}`. `choosePerMode` + `buttonNumber` + `perMode={modeIdOrName: [deviceIds], ...}`.
- **Run Custom Action** (`capability='runCommand'`): `command` + `deviceIds` + `capabilityFilter` (default `'Switch'`) + optional `parameters=[{type:'number',value:75},...]` + optional `useLastEventDevice`. Each parameter entry may be a literal (`{type:'number', value:75}`) or variable-sourced (`{type:'number', variable:'myVar'}`); the two forms may be mixed across slots. The `type` field is lowercase (`number`, `decimal`, `string`) -- the validator at `_rmAddAction` only accepts lowercase. Calls any device-driver command (`off`, `on`, `setLevel`, `flashOff`, `refresh`, custom-driver verbs, etc.) on the device list. Use this to call commands not exposed by the higher-level capability mappings.
- **File IO** (`capability='fileWrite'`/`'fileAppend'`/`'fileDelete'`): `fileWrite` + `fileName` + `content` (overwrites). `fileAppend` + `fileName` + `content` (file must exist; `localFile` is an enum picker). `fileDelete` + `fileName`.
- **Z-Wave Polling** (`capability='zwavePoll'`): `action='start'`/`'stop'` + `deviceIds` (Z-Wave switches/dimmers only) + `target='switches'|'dimmers'`.
- **Lock** (`capability='lock'`): `action='lock'`/`'unlock'` + `deviceIds`.
- **HSM** (`capability='hsm'`): `command=armAway/armHome/armNight/disarm/rearm/disarmAll/armRules/cancelAlerts`. No deviceIds, because HSM is a hub-level service rather than a device-based capability. `getSetHSM` appears only when HSM is installed on the hub; there is no `armAll` -- use `armRules`.
- **Thermostat** (`capability='thermostat'`): `action=(any)` + `deviceIds` + optional `mode`/`fanMode`/`heatingSetpoint`/`coolingSetpoint`/`adjustHeating`/`adjustCooling`.
- **Shade/blind** (`capability='shade'`): `open`/`close`/`stop` + `deviceIds`. `setPosition` + `deviceIds` + `position` (0–100).
- **Fan** (`capability='fan'`): `setSpeed` + `deviceIds` + `speed` (low/med/high/auto/etc.). `cycle` + `deviceIds`.
  - **NOTE:** fan `setSpeed` takes a fixed enum speed only (low / medium-low / medium / medium-high / high / on / off / auto); RM has no variable-sourced fan speed (unlike dimmer `setLevel`'s `levelVariable`) because the classic wizard exposes a variable toggle only for numeric/text value fields, not enum pickers. For a variable-driven speed, use `capability='runCommand'` with `command='setSpeed'` + `parameters=[{type:'string', variable:'<varName>'}]` (per-parameter variable sourcing).
- **Mode** (`capability='mode'`): `action='setMode'` + `modeId` (Integer) OR `modeName` (String, case-insensitive). When `modeName` is supplied it is resolved to the numeric mode ID via `location.modes` before the write; an unknown name fails fast with the list of valid mode names. Use `hub_list_modes` to inspect available modes first. Note: `addAction` mode uses the `modeName` field for explicit name-based resolution; `addTrigger` mode uses the generic `state` field instead because triggers cover a superset of device-state events where a single field serves multiple capability types -- `modeName` vs `state` is an intentional surface difference, not a typo.
- **Hub Variable** (`capability='setVariable'`, alias `'variable'`): `variable` (target) + exactly ONE source mode -- `value` (numeric constant), `sourceVariable` (copy from another hub variable), `fromDevice` (`{deviceId, attribute}` -- read a device attribute), or `math` (`{left, op, right}` -- structured variable math). All variable names (`variable`, `sourceVariable`, `math` var-operands) must be existing hub variable names -- unknown names are rejected before any write. The four source modes are mutually exclusive; providing more than one is rejected. `math` binary operators (`+ - * / %`) require `right`; unary operators (`negate absolute round random sqrt sin cos tan asin acos atan log toRadians toDegrees`) reject `right`. A `math` operand that is a number becomes a literal constant; a string operand is a variable name. `fromDevice` reads from any hub device (not just MCP-selected); an attribute not in the device's filtered enum is rejected with `success=false` and the device's available-attribute list. See `addAction setVariable` in `docs/rm_action_subtype_schemas.md` for the full field reference.
- **Rule-local Variable** (`capability='setLocalVariable'`): identical shape and source modes to `setVariable` (`variable` target + exactly one of `value`/`sourceVariable`/`fromDevice`/`math`), EXCEPT the `variable` target is validated against the rule's LOCAL variables (`state.allLocalVars`) instead of hub globals. Use this -- not `setVariable` -- when a local and a hub variable share a name and you mean the local; it cannot silently target the global. `sourceVariable`/`math` operands may be either local or hub (RM's source picker spans both; validated against the live revealed enum). Create a local first via `addLocalVariable`; list current locals via `hub_list_rule_local_variables` (in `hub_read_rules`). The picker section headers ` --LOCAL VARIABLES--` / ` --HUB VARIABLES--` are rejected as targets.
- **Logging / Messaging**: `capability='log' + message`. `capability='notification' + deviceIds + message`. `capability='httpGet' + url`. `capability='httpPost' + url + body + optional contentType`. `capability='ping' + ip`.
- **Music/Sound** (`capability='volume'`/`'mute'`/`'chime'`/`'siren'`): `volume + deviceIds + level`. `mute + action='mute'/'unmute' + deviceIds`. `chime + deviceIds + optional playStop/soundNumber`. `siren + deviceIds + optional sirenAction`.
- **Rules** (`capability='privateBoolean'`/`'runRule'`/`'cancelTimers'`/`'pauseRule'`): `privateBoolean + ruleIds + value (Boolean)`. `runRule + ruleIds` (runs actions). `cancelTimers + ruleIds`. `pauseRule + action='pause'/'resume' + ruleIds`. Raw `pvTF.<N>` and `pR.<N>` store the inverse of the rendered True/False (`pR`: `false`=pause, `true`=resume); the rendered paragraph is ground truth, so do not "fix" readbacks against the raw field. For all four, each `ruleIds` target must resolve to an existing Rule Machine rule -- checked against the live RM rule list before any write -- and a target id that is not an existing rule is rejected fail-loud ("RM is not touched"), steering to `hub_list_rules`, rather than baking a dangling rule reference that renders broken and never fires. On a hub whose rule list can't be resolved (RM not installed or the app-tree read failed) the check is skipped and the write proceeds. A hub with zero rules is NOT a can't-resolve case: every rule target is then rejected fail-loud.
- **Activate a Scene / Room Lighting group**: RM 5.1 has no dedicated activate-scene action subtype. Each Scene / Room Lighting instance spawns an activator device with the switch capability -- activate it via the Switch action: `capability='switch' + action='on' + deviceIds=[<activatorDeviceId>]` (use `action='off'` to send an off/deactivate command, whose effect is configuration-dependent). The `activate_scene` action lives ONLY on the legacy custom rule engine (the `hub_*_custom_rule` tools / `hub_get_tool_guide(section='rules')`), not on this native addAction surface.
- **Device control**: `capability='capture' + deviceIds`. `capability='restore'` (no fields). `capability='refresh' + deviceIds`. `capability='poll' + deviceIds`. `capability='disableDevice' + action='disable'/'enable' + deviceIds`.
- **Flow control** (delay/wait/repeat/exit/comment/conditional):
  - `delay` + `hours`/`minutes`/`seconds` + optional `cancelable`/`random` OR `variable=<varName>` (variable-sourced seconds)
  - `delayPerMode` + `perMode={modeIdOrName: {hours, minutes, seconds}, ...}`
  - `cancelDelay`, `exitRule`, `stopRepeat` (no fields)
  - `comment` + `text`
  - `repeat` + `hours`/`minutes`/`seconds` + optional `times` + `stoppable`
  - `repeatWhile` + `expression={conditions:[...], operator?:..., operators?:[...]}` + optional `hours`/`minutes`/`seconds`/`times`/`stoppable`
  - `waitExpression` + `expression={...}` + optional `delay={hours,minutes,seconds}` + `useDuration=true|false`
  - `waitEvents` + `events=[{capability, deviceIds, state, andStays?}, ...]`. Per-event `andStays` is `true` (zero extra duration; empty map `{}` equivalent) OR `{hours?,minutes?,seconds?}` -> dash-indexed `SHours-/SMins-/SSecs-<N>` (distinct from the trigger's no-dash `SHours<N>`). A **Mode** event uses `{capability:'Mode', state:<mode name or list of names>}` or `{capability:'Mode', modeIds:[...]}` (`deviceIds` is rejected on a Mode event; the mode is written to RM's mode picker, not `tstate`). **LIMIT**: only ONE `waitEvents` action per rule; RM 5.1 stores wait events in global per-rule settings (not per-action), so a second `waitEvents` action silently overwrites the first. Combine multiple waits into one action's `events` array, or split into chained sub-rules.
  - `ifThen` + `expression={...}` (opens IF block; close with `endIf`)
  - `elseIf` + `expression={...}` (continues IF block; needs preceding `ifThen`)
  - `else` (no fields; needs preceding `ifThen` or `elseIf`)
  - `endIf` (no fields; closes the IF block)

### `addRequiredExpression` STPage capability list

RM 5.1 Required Expression conditions accept these `capability` values (per-condition):

- **Device-state**: `Switch`, `Motion`, `Contact`, `Lock`, `Presence`, `Smoke detector`, `Water sensor`, `Tamper alert`, `Acceleration`, `Carbon monoxide detector`, `Carbon dioxide sensor`, `Power source`, `Window Shade`
- **Numeric**: `Battery`, `Dimmer`, `Energy meter`, `Fan Speed`, `Humidity`, `Illuminance`, `Power meter`, `Temperature`, `Thermostat cool setpoint`, `Thermostat fan mode`, `Thermostat heat setpoint`, `Thermostat mode`, `Thermostat state`
- **Time-based**: `Days of week`, `Between two dates`, `Between two times`, `On a Day`
- **Hub state**: `Mode`, `Private Boolean`
- **Variable comparison**: `Variable`
- **Custom / other**: `Custom Attribute`, `Last Event Device` (not a condition -- see note below), `Lock codes` (not authorable here -- see note below)

Note: `Last Event Device` appears in the STPage condition picker but is not usable as a condition -- it references the device that fired the rule's trigger (an action-side reference, used in actions such as running a command on the triggering device), not a testable state, and it is not a trigger capability either. It is rejected fail-loud on every structured condition surface (`addRequiredExpression`, `addTrigger.condition`, and the `addAction` expression subtypes); remove it from the expression. `Lock codes` likewise appears in the STPage condition picker but cannot be authored through the structured condition path -- a Lock codes condition needs a lock device plus a specific code name and the tool has no field for either, so it is rejected fail-loud with a pointer to the Rule Machine UI; author it there or use a different testable capability.

Note: `Private Boolean` is only valid in Required Expressions -- it does NOT appear in the IF-expression capability list used by `ifThen`/`elseIf`/`repeatWhile`/`waitExpression`.

Note: some sensor capabilities (Water sensor, Smoke detector, Carbon monoxide detector, Tamper alert, Acceleration) report discrete events rather than a continuous enum state. Pass `state: 'wet'` / `state: 'dry'` for Water sensor, `state: 'detected'` / `state: 'clear'` for detector types (Smoke, CO, Tamper), `state: 'active'` / `state: 'inactive'` for Acceleration -- NOT a comparator-based numeric condition. Carbon dioxide sensor is intentionally EXCLUDED from the discrete-event list: the `CarbonDioxideMeasurement` capability is numeric ppm (use comparator + value), not a discrete enum; the names look superficially symmetric to Carbon monoxide detector but RM 5.1 treats them differently. See `docs/rm_action_subtype_schemas.md` for the full state-value table.

### Extended per-capability spec shapes

Applies to `addRequiredExpression.conditions[]` (STPage) and `addAction.expression.conditions[]` (doActPage); the shared walker `_rmWalkConditionReveal` handles every per-capability reveal sequence below. `addTrigger.condition` has a narrower support list (see selectTriggers note below).

- **Mode**: `{capability:'Mode', state:'Night'}` or `{capability:'Mode', modeIds:['3']}`. Walker resolves mode names to IDs via `location.modes` and writes the firmware-assigned `modes<N>` picker discovered from the live schema.
- **Between two times**: `{capability:'Between two times', start:{type:'clock'|'sunrise'|'sunset', time?:'HH:mm', offset?:<minutes>}, end:{...same shape}}`. Precondition: hub `location.timeZone` must be configured.
- **Variable comparison**: `{capability:'Variable', variable:'<hubVarName>', comparator:'=', value:<v>}` for a constant RHS, OR `{capability:'Variable', variable:'<hubVarName>', comparator:'=', compareToVariable:'<otherHubVarName>'}` for a variable-vs-variable RHS. A free-valued (String) variable (and a free-valued Custom Attribute) also accepts the STRING comparator `*contains*` (substring match, written verbatim -- keep the asterisks; the substring is the `value`); there is no "does not contain" -- negate with `not:true` + `*contains*`. For value-comparison comparators supply exactly one of `value`/`compareToVariable` -- they are mutually exclusive (passing both is rejected); omit the RHS entirely for state-change comparators (`*changed*`/`*became*`). For the variable RHS the walker toggles `isVar_<N>=true` and discovers the firmware-assigned right-hand picker from the live schema -- it does NOT hardcode `xVarR_<N>` because `selectTriggers` consistently exposes `xVarR` but the walker pages (STPage/doActPage) can expose a differently-suffixed field, so the walker resolves whatever the live schema reveals. Fail-loud when a variable name is not in the schema enum AND the option list is non-empty; degrades with an `api_unavailable` sentinel (`variable-validation` for the LHS picker, `compareToVariable-validation` for the RHS picker) when the enum is empty, flipping `partial`. A Boolean variable has no comparator field: pass `value:true|false` (optionally `comparator:'='`, negate with `not:true`); any other comparator, a `compareToVariable`, or a value other than true/false is rejected before the Boolean value is written. The capability and variable pickers are already written by then, so the rejection cancels the in-flight condition. A page that also shows a comparator field is treated as a comparison, not a Boolean.
- **Device-relative comparison**: `{capability:'Temperature', deviceIds:[N], comparator:'>', compareToDevice:{deviceId:M, attribute?:'temperature', offset?:-2}}`. The RHS is another device's reading on the SAME capability, optionally offset. The walker writes the comparator `RelrDev_<N>`, toggles `isDev_<N>=true` to reveal the SINGLE reference-device picker `relDevice_<N>`, writes the reference id, then writes the optional decimal offset to `state_<N>` (omit -> offset 0). `relDevice_<N>` is a capability.* device picker locked to the LHS capability; on normal firmware RM populates its dropdown client-side, so the schema exposes no options and the empty option list is normal. The reference `deviceId` is existence-validated hub-wide before any write; a nonexistent id is rejected up front. On the rare firmware variant that DOES surface device-picker options, the walker additionally defensively rejects a reference id not in that list. Mutually exclusive with a literal RHS (`state`/`value`) and with `compareToVariable` -- supply exactly one RHS shape. There is NO separate reference-attribute picker: the compared attribute is implied by the shared capability, so `compareToDevice.attribute` is OPTIONAL and informational (no wire consumer; neither validated nor written). Passing compareToDevice on a non-numeric capability (Mode / Between two times / Variable / Custom Attribute) is rejected up front with a fail-loud error naming the capability -- it is NOT silently dropped. **Intentional isDev/isVar asymmetry (do not "fix"):** an EMPTY option list is NORMAL for `compareToDevice`'s `relDevice_<N>` because it is a capability.* DEVICE picker (RM fills it client-side), so no options, no sentinel, no partial. This deliberately differs from `compareToVariable`, whose right-hand picker is an ENUM picker where an empty option list IS an anomaly and emits an `api_unavailable` sentinel with `partial:true`. The divergence reflects picker type (device vs enum), not an oversight.
- **Sub-expression (parens) -- addRequiredExpression-only**: `{subExpression:{conditions:[...], operator?:'AND'|'OR'|'XOR', operators?:[...]}}`. The STPage walker recursively handles nesting of arbitrary depth. **`addAction` (ifThen/elseIf/repeatWhile/waitExpression) REJECTS nested subExpression** with `"nested subExpression on this row is not yet supported"`. Flatten the conditions list, or move the nested expression to a Required Expression.

`addTrigger.condition` supports a narrower subset: Variable (incl. `compareToVariable`), Custom Attribute, and enum/numeric device-state. Mode-via-picker / Between two times / compareToDevice are NOT yet supported on `selectTriggers` -- the `_rmBuildCondition` helper is a static direct-write path, not the shared `_rmWalkConditionReveal` walker. The time/date-window capabilities reject fail-loud rather than committing a broken condition: `Between two times` steers you to `addRequiredExpression` or an `ifThen` action (where its start/end time-picker walk IS implemented), and `Between two dates` / `Days of week` / `On a Day` -- whose date/day pickers are unmodelled on EVERY structured condition surface -- steer you to author them directly against the wizard via `rawSettings` or a `walkStep` call.

### Supported comparison shapes for a numeric condition

A numeric device condition's right-hand side can be one of these shapes (the RM 5.1 wizard exposes the `isDev_` device-RHS toggle but no `isVar_` toggle on a numeric device condition, so "device attribute vs a hub variable" is NOT a directly-supported shape):

- a) **Device attribute vs literal value** -- `{capability:'Temperature', deviceIds:[N], comparator:'>', value:72}`.
- b) **Device attribute vs another device's same attribute** (`compareToDevice`, numeric capabilities only) -- `{capability:'Temperature', deviceIds:[N], comparator:'>', compareToDevice:{deviceId:M, offset?:-2}}`. The reference reads the SAME capability; `offset` is optional.
- c) **Variable vs variable** (`compareToVariable`, Variable-capability LHS only) -- `{capability:'Variable', variable:'<hubVarName>', comparator:'=', compareToVariable:'<otherHubVarName>'}`.

To compare a **device attribute against a hub variable**, there is no direct shape -- read the attribute into a variable first with an `addAction setVariable` using `fromDevice` (`{deviceId, attribute}`), then compare variable-vs-variable per shape (c).

### `addRequiredExpression` operator contract

Combine multiple conditions with `operator: 'AND'|'OR'|'XOR'` (one operator applied to every gap) OR `operators: ['AND','OR', ...]` (one per gap; length = `conditions.size()-1`) for mixed expressions like `P1 AND P2 OR P3 XOR P4`. RM 5.1: AND/OR/XOR have equal precedence, evaluated left-to-right.

### `replaceRequiredExpression` -- change an existing Required Expression in place

`addRequiredExpression` refuses (`requiredExpressionAlreadyExists:true`) when the rule already has a committed Required Expression. To CHANGE it, use `replaceRequiredExpression` -- same `appId`, no clone. The spec shape is IDENTICAL to `addRequiredExpression` (`{conditions:[...], operator|operators}`, all the same per-condition fields and extended per-capability shapes, including nested `subExpression`), so the replacement may be single-condition, multi-condition, or nested. Semantics are WHOLE-expression replace (the entire formula is cleared), matching `addRequiredExpression`'s add semantics.

Mechanism: clicks `cancelST` ("Delete Required Expression") to remove the whole committed expression, then builds the new condition(s) by delegating to the same `addRequiredExpression` walker (which navigates fresh from `mainPage`, sets `useST`, reaches the `cond` new-condition selector, and seals via `hasRule`/`doneST` + the sub-page Done), and fires `updateRule`.

- Precondition: a committed Required Expression MUST already exist. If none does, returns `success:false, requiredExpressionMissing:true` steering you to `addRequiredExpression` -- a replace never silently becomes an add.
- Destructive-window contract: the `cancelST` delete is immediately destructive (the committed gate is gone the instant it is clicked). Protections: (1) the ENTIRE spec is validated BEFORE the click (conditions/operator/operators rules, deviceId existence), so a malformed spec fails with the OLD expression intact; (2) after the delete succeeds, ANY failure auto-restores the pre-op backup -- INCLUDING a post-commit health flip (the rebuild baked but left the rule unhealthy, e.g. a ghost-`ifThen` clear wrapped it in `IF(**Broken Condition**)`) OR a rejected trailing `updateRule` click, because the trailing finalize runs inside the same restore window as the delete. The result then carries `requiredExpressionReplaced:false` + `requiredExpressionRestored:true` (original restored from backup) OR `requiredExpressionRestored:false` (DELETED and auto-restore also failed -- the error names the `hub_restore_backup(backupKey=...)` recovery) OR `requiredExpressionRestored:false` + `requiredExpressionRestoredAs:<newId>` (auto-restore could not reuse the original appId and recreated the rule under a NEW id -- the original appId is dead; use the new id and delete the husk). A post-delete failure is NEVER a benign no-op.
- Fail-loud: if the `cancelST` delete is silently rejected (STPage still shows the committed-expression controls), the helper restores the pre-op backup and returns `success:false` naming the step; the existing expression is preserved. Inspect via `hub_get_app_config(appId)`.
- Success envelope: `requiredExpressionReplaced:true` (a NEW expression was COMMITTED, not merely the old one deleted; may not be live yet if `updateRuleFailed` -- check `expressionNotLive`) plus the same `conditionIndices`/`settingsApplied`/`settingsSkipped`/`partial`/`repairHints` envelope and trailing-updateRule slots (`updateRuleFailed`/`expressionNotLive`/`updateRuleError`) as `addRequiredExpression`.
- Deleted-condition residue: on a SUCCESSFUL replace the deleted condition's underlying settings linger in the pool but are NOT part of the active formula -- harmless, renders cleanly, no cleanup write issued. New slot indices continue past the deleted slot.
- Committed-RE detection: a committed expression is detected by the `cancelST` + `editST` control pair (a two-field tell, intentionally narrower than `addRequiredExpression`'s three-field check because that pair is firmware-stable on 5.1.8 while `stopOnST` varies across revisions).

Also a valid `patches[]` op (reported as `op: 'replaceRequiredExpression'`). Inside a `patches[]` batch the auto-restore is scoped to a per-op snapshot taken just before the op, so a failed replace op does NOT revert earlier successful ops in the same batch.

### `addAction` variable-sourced values, not-yet-mapped capabilities, wire-format quirks

- **Variable-sourced values**: `dimmer setLevel` accepts `levelVariable:'<hubVarName>'` instead of `level`; `delay` accepts `variable:'<hubVarName>'` instead of `hours`/`minutes`/`seconds`. Both write the wizard's `uVar=true` + `xVar=<varName>` pair so the value resolves at fire time from a hub variable.
- **Not yet mapped -- use the `rawSettings` escape hatch with the `@N` index token**: Garage door open/close, Valve open/close (different lockActs subtypes, only visible with the corresponding device).
- **Wire-format quirks the helper handles for you**: (1) the 'Create New Action' button (`name=N`) requires `stateAttribute='doActN'` concatenated, not `'doAct'` -- sending `'doAct'` alone leaves `state.doActN` null and `doActPage` NPEs. (2) `doActPage`'s schema is incremental -- `actionDone` only appears after all required type-specific fields are set; the helper re-fetches the schema before each write. (3) `selectActions` initializes `state.actNdx`; on a freshly created zero-action rule `state.actNdx` is null and `doActPage` renders `actType.null` (broken), so the helper fires an idempotent empty POST to `selectActions` first.

### `walkStep` schema-aware wizard walker

`walkStep` is the lowest-level escape hatch: drive the RM wizard when the high-level `addTrigger`/`addAction` helpers don't cover the capability you need (Periodic Schedule sub-pages, conditional-trigger binding, IF/THEN/ELSE flow control, features added in a later firmware). Each single-step call returns a structured snapshot -- schema before/after, schema diff (inputs appeared/disappeared), value-echo (catches silent enum case normalization), sub-page hrefs, action/trigger list-count change (disambiguates 'committed' from 'broke and lost the row'), and a health check.

Spec: `{page, operation, write?:{<field>:<value>}, click?:{name,stateAttribute?}, navigate?:{targetPage}, validateEnum?:<bool>, hrefContext?:{fromPage,hrefName,hrefParams?,hrefIndex?}, steps?:[...]}` where `page` is e.g. `selectTriggers`/`selectActions`/`doActPage`/`mainPage`/`periodic` and `operation` is one of:
- `drive` -- **preferred**: run an ordered `steps=[...]` list (each item a single-step spec) in ONE call. The tool performs them in sequence, carrying the page forward across `navigate`/`done`, and stops at the first failed step (`stopOnError=false` to continue). A step that omits `page` inherits the page the previous step ended on. Returns `{steps:[{step, operation, page, success, diff, valueEcho, silentRejection, commitSignal, opResult, health}, ...], stepsRequested, stepsRun, lastStepOperation, success, health}`; on a halt the aggregate also carries a top-level `error` + `repairHints` naming the failed step. A finished drive fails when a step fails (the top-level `error` and `repairHints` name it) or when the rule ends with a structural issue the drive introduced, listed in `structuralIssues` (for example a block it opened and never closed: add the closer, or restore). Structural issues that were already present before the drive are listed in `preExistingStructuralIssues` and do not fail it, so building inside an already-open block across calls is allowed. That exemption needs a structural baseline read before the first step; if the read fails, pre-existing issues cannot be told apart from new ones and fail the drive, and the result carries `baselineUnavailable` with the reason, so compare with `hub_get_rule_health` before re-running. `healthUnverified:true` (with `success:false` and `partial:true`) marks a finished drive with at least one mutating step whose final health check the time budget skipped: its steps are committed, so check `hub_get_rule_health` rather than re-running the drive. A drive the budget pauses between steps instead returns `status:'in_progress'` with `stepsRemaining`. End the drive with a `done` step to fire the mainPage Done finalize (the `updateRule`-equivalent that re-initializes subscriptions) — the same finalize a single-step `done` gets. This automates the manual loop below.
- `introspect` -- fetch schema; no mutation.
- `write` -- write one field's value (exactly one key per call; `hrefContext` for sub-pages).
- `click` -- click a regular button (`cancelCapab`, `hasAll`, `moreCond`, ...).
- `navigate` -- forward into a sub-page via its href.
- `done` -- BACK-navigate from a sub-page to its parent (`_action_previous=Done`), carrying ALL the sub-page's current settings. REQUIRED for sub-pages (Periodic, etc.) whose parent row otherwise renders `?`. Pass `hrefContext={fromPage:<parent>, hrefParams:{n:<idx>}}`.

The loop `drive` automates (and the sequence to put in `steps[]`): `introspect` to see the page's fields -> `navigate` into a sub-page if one is exposed -> `write` each required field (with `hrefContext` on sub-pages) -> inspect `diff.appeared`/`valueEcho.match`/`silentRejection` between writes -> `done` to back out of a sub-page (this bakes the trigger/action description) -> `click` `hasAll`/`actionDone` on the parent to finalize the row. Always check `silentRejection`, `valueEcho.match`, and `health` in each step's snapshot -- they are the fail-loud signals. A page that rendered empty on a `navigate` (or on an `hrefContext` re-render) is re-read once and `opResult.navRetried: true` says the re-read supplied the page; if `after` is still empty the page really is (see `commitSignal`). A page RM could not build comes back with `pageError` (RM's own render text, e.g. a `doActPage` entered by name without the wizard state it expects) and a repair hint -- that empty schema has a stated cause and is never re-read. On health: `skipped: true` means the probe was deliberately not run (time budget spent) and `unreadable: true` means it could not be read -- neither is evidence of breakage; only a checked verdict (broken/issues with unreadable false) is.

Worked `drive` example (a multi-device switch trigger committed in one call, the `steps[]` form of the raw-mode example below). The trailing `done` is what runs the mainPage Done finalize (raw-mode step 6, `updateRule`); without it the trigger is written to settings but never subscribed, so the rule looks created yet never fires:
```
hub_set_rule(appId=N, confirm=true, walkStep={operation:'drive', steps:[
  {page:'selectTriggers', operation:'click', click:{name:'true', stateAttribute:'moreCond'}},
  {page:'selectTriggers', operation:'write', write:{tCapab1:'Switch'}},
  {page:'selectTriggers', operation:'write', write:{tDev1:[<deviceId>, ...]}},
  {page:'selectTriggers', operation:'write', write:{tstate1:'on'}},
  {page:'selectTriggers', operation:'click', click:{name:'hasAll'}},
  {page:'selectTriggers', operation:'done'}]})
```

A standalone mutating `walkStep` (`write`, `click`, `navigate`, or `done`) whose time budget skips the health probe also returns `success:false`, `partial:true`, and `healthUnverified:true` when the operation otherwise succeeded. This is a terminal request with committed work, not a checkpoint to replay: call `hub_get_rule_health(appId=...)` and address any issue before continuing or treating the rule as complete. Read-only `introspect` and the deliberately deferred per-step health inside an unfinished drive do not acquire that failure flag. Modern detached writes discard the request clock and check health normally; the budget case primarily affects legacy requests. An unreadable probe remains separately identified by `health.unreadable` and its verification hint.

### Raw `settings`/`button` mode (manual wizard flow)

Prefer the structured shortcuts above. Raw mode is the unstructured escape hatch: write page inputs via `settings` and click page-transition buttons via `button` directly.

- **Auto-updateRule**: main-page `settings` writes are auto-followed by an implicit `updateRule` click so `initialize()` re-fires. Sub-page writes (`pageName=selectTriggers`/`selectActions`/...) SKIP the auto-click so the wizard's `stateAttribute` (`moreCond`, `editCond`, `editAct`, ...) survives -- commit the wizard via its own Done button (RM triggers: `hasAll`; RM actions: `actionDone`), then issue a final `hub_set_rule(button='updateRule')` yourself to re-initialize.
- **mainPage boolean flags** -- some rule-level toggles are plain mainPage booleans you set directly via `settings`, distinct from the structured shortcuts:
  - `settings:{useST:true}` -- the "Use Required Expression" flag. It only EXPOSES the Required Expression sub-page (the "Define Required Expression" href); it does NOT author any condition. Use `addRequiredExpression` to build the actual expression (which sets `useST` for you). Setting `useST:true` bare, with no expression, just reveals an empty RE surface.
  - `settings:{isFunction:true}` -- the "function mode" flag (the rule returns a value so other rules can call it as a function). No structured shortcut; write it directly.
  Both are mainPage writes, so they auto-commit via `updateRule` per the Auto-updateRule rule above.
- **Wizard-Done auto-finalize**: clicking `hasAll` on `selectTriggers` commits the trigger but RM 5.1 leaves a residual `isCondTrig.<N>` ("Conditional Trigger?") prompt; the tool auto-writes `isCondTrig.<N>=false` to clear it without consuming a trigger index, reported as `wizardDoneAutoRetry: 'OK' | 'OK after finalize ...' | 'WARN: ...'`. (Earlier versions clicked `hasAll` twice, which allocated phantom **Broken Trigger** rows; the finalize-via-`isCondTrig` path keeps indices contiguous 1, 2, 3.)
- **Worked example -- multi-device switch trigger via raw mode**:
  1. `hub_set_rule(appId, button='true', stateAttribute='moreCond', pageName='selectTriggers')` -- opens the trigger editor.
  2. `hub_set_rule(appId, settings={tCapab1:'Switch'}, pageName='selectTriggers')` -- picks the capability; page re-renders the device picker.
  3. `hub_set_rule(appId, settings={tDev1:[<deviceId>, ...]}, pageName='selectTriggers')` -- writes devices (multi-device 3-field contract automatic).
  4. `hub_set_rule(appId, settings={tstate1:'on'}, pageName='selectTriggers')` -- sets the attribute/value.
  5. `hub_set_rule(appId, button='hasAll', pageName='selectTriggers')` -- commits; residual Conditional? prompt auto-finalized.
  6. `hub_set_rule(appId, button='updateRule')` -- re-initialize so subscriptions populate.
  The `addTrigger={...}` shortcut performs steps 1-6 automatically. A second trigger uses index 2 (`tCapab2`/`tDev2`/`tstate2`), a third index 3, etc.

### Partial-success and trailing-updateRule response slots

`settingsSkipped[]` sentinel reasons callers may see:
- `offset_field_not_revealed` -- compareToDevice optional offset field (`state_<N>`) absent after the reference-device write (firmware may not expose the offset slot for this capability); the offset is dropped but the device-relative comparison is otherwise complete. Flips `partial:true`.
- `api_unavailable` paired with `key: "variable-validation"` (LHS Variable picker) OR `key: "compareToVariable-validation"` (RHS variable picker for `compareToVariable`) -- the ENUM picker returned an empty option list; write proceeds unvalidated. Flips `partial:true`. NOTE: `compareToDevice` does NOT emit this -- its `relDevice_<N>` reference picker is a capability.* DEVICE picker that exposes no options client-side, so an empty option list is normal and is NOT treated as a validation gap (no sentinel, no partial). A wrong-capability reference device surfaces in the rendered/broken state, not a pre-write option check.
- `not_in_schema` -- a written field was absent from the current page schema, so the value did not land. Genuine degradation on addTrigger, the condition wizard, AND the walker pages (STPage/doActPage); flips `partial:true`. A state-change comparator like `*changed*` is written as a value into the comparator field on a free-valued attribute (where the comparator IS exposed), so a clean trigger produces no `not_in_schema` skip on a real field. Two exempt cases do NOT flip `partial`. (1) The cosmetic `isCondTrig.<N>` post-commit finalize toggle on addTrigger -- its absence is a clean exit, and the skip that would otherwise be produced is exempted. (2) A VALUE comparator (`=`/`<`/etc.) on the enum-recognized Custom Attribute across all FOUR wizard surfaces -- the trigger row (`ReltDev<N>`), the conditional-trigger condition wizard (`RelrDev_<N>`), the STPage walker, and the doActPage walker. Here the comparator is deliberately NOT written, so NO skip is produced in the first place (this case is exempt from `partial` by construction, not by exempting a produced skip): when the hub treats the attribute as an ENUM (switch, motion, contact, lock, ...) the re-render reveals the value picker (`tstate<N>` / `state_<N>`) and HIDES the comparator, the helper detects the picker is exposed and writes only the value, and partial stays false. The exception is a no-RHS state-change comparator (`*changed*` / `*became*`) on an enum attribute: there is no comparator slot AND no value for the picker, so unless the picker offers a change-equivalent option the comparator is unrepresentable and the helper emits a `comparator_not_representable_for_enum_attribute` skip (flips `partial`) instead of a false clean success. A free-valued attribute still reveals and writes the comparator normally. The walker's two Custom Attribute sites diverge on the neither-rendered edge case: the dedicated capability-block (Site A) throws because its reveal-step contract has no field to write into without a revealed target, whereas the default enum/numeric block (Site B) still attempts the write because its `writeST` POSTs-then-verifies (no schema-containment pre-gate) -- on a hidden field the post-write verify records a `silent_rejection` skip that flips `partial`, surfacing the degradation without hard-failing the wizard, which is less strict than Site A's throw but still honest about the value loss. (Site B normalizes the comparator and writes it comparator-first: whenever `RelrDev_<N>` is exposed, OR when neither field rendered; it suppresses the comparator only for the positively-detected enum case.) On the trigger row and condition wizard the analogous neither-rendered write goes through `_rmWriteSettingOnPage`, which DOES schema-gate: the comparator is not POSTed and a `not_in_schema` skip flips `partial` instead. On a TRANSIENT exposure-probe re-fetch failure (empty/unparseable hub response after the attribute write), all four surfaces now degrade gracefully rather than aborting: the comparator is force-written best-effort and a `comparator_force_written_unverified` skip flips `partial` (verify via `hub_get_app_config`).
- `reveal_fallback_to_existing_field` -- walker matched an already-visible field instead of a newly-revealed one (static-schema firmware). INFORMATIONAL -- does NOT flip `partial` by itself.
- `useST_idempotent_noop` -- the idempotent `useST=true` mainPage toggle (Step 1 of addRequiredExpression) was already set, so the write did not advance the schema. INFORMATIONAL -- does NOT flip `partial` by itself, because the toggle write is idempotent and the schema rejection is cosmetic (the required-expression href is already exposed), not a lost value.
- `device_list_committed_schema_unchanged` -- a device-picker action field (`onOffSwitch.<N>`, `shadeOpenClose.<N>`, `lockLockUnlock.<N>`, `fanRL.<N>`, ...) is written last and reveals no further schema; its value lives in the hub's `deviceIdsForDeviceList` side-structure, not `settings[<key>]`, so the write cannot be seen to advance and is first tagged `silent_rejection`. When the requested device IDs are verified present in the committed rule (value-echo check against `statusJson`), the skip is re-tagged to this INFORMATIONAL reason (the skip entry then carries the committed IDs as `committedDeviceIds`) and does NOT flip `partial`. A genuine failed device write (IDs absent from the echo) keeps `silent_rejection` and still flips `partial:true`.
- `comparator_force_written_unverified` -- on a Custom Attribute add, the exposure-probe re-fetch (issued after writing the attribute to decide whether the comparator is still exposed) failed transiently, so the comparator was force-written straight to the page as a fallback. The value is in `settingsApplied` and `success` stays true, but it could not be schema-confirmed -- flips `partial:true`. Verify via `hub_get_app_config`.
- `comparator_force_write_failed` -- the force-write fallback above ALSO failed (the hub rejected the POST, e.g. a stale version token). The comparator did not land. Genuine degradation -- flips `partial:true`. The rest of the trigger/condition still committed; re-add the comparator via `hub_set_rule(walkStep=...)` or rebuild the row.
- `comparator_not_representable_for_enum_attribute` -- a no-RHS state-change comparator (`*changed*` / the `*became*` family) was requested on a Custom Attribute the hub recognizes as an ENUM (switch/motion/contact/lock/...). RM exposes only the value picker (e.g. on/off) for such an attribute, with no comparator slot, so a no-value change comparator cannot be represented through this path. Genuine degradation -- flips `partial:true` with a repair hint. To express "this attribute changed", trigger on the device's native capability instead (e.g. `capability:'Switch'`), or use a non-built-in attribute name (RM treats those as free-valued and exposes a real comparator). Applies across all four wizard surfaces. If the value picker happens to offer a change-equivalent option, the helper routes it there and no skip is produced.
- `change_comparator_not_representable_for_device_state` -- the device-state sibling of the entry above, on an `addTrigger` device-state capability (Switch/Motion/Contact/Lock/Water/Smoke/...). A device-state capability has no comparator field; its `tstate<N>` value picker carries both the state enum and any change option. When a no-RHS state-change comparator is requested but the live picker offers no matching change option, the change token cannot land and is reported here instead of being written to the absent `ReltDev<N>` (which would render the trigger "turns null"). Flips `partial:true`; the skip carries `pickerOptions` and a `hint` to write `tstate<N>` directly via `walkStep`. Routing is decided by the LIVE rendered field, so it covers every device-state capability, not just those the discover schema enumerates.
- `state_change_comparator_ignored_explicit_value` -- INFORMATIONAL (does NOT flip `partial`). A no-RHS state-change comparator was requested ALONGSIDE an explicit `state`/`value` (a contradictory spec). It fires on a device-state or enum Custom Attribute trigger AND on an enum Custom Attribute condition across the condition surfaces (the conditional-trigger condition wizard, STPage, and doActPage). The explicit value wins into the value picker and the row works as an equals-check, so the dropped change intent is reported informationally. Keyed on a synthetic non-field key (`comparator@tstate<N>` on the device-state trigger path, the hidden `ReltDev<N>` on the Custom Attribute trigger path, the hidden `RelrDev_<N>` on the Custom Attribute condition surfaces) so the real value-picker field is never listed in both `settingsApplied` and `settingsSkipped`.
- `state_change_route_unverified_fetch_failed` -- the post-device-write `selectTriggers` re-fetch (needed to inspect which field the wizard renders before placing a state-change comparator) failed transiently, so the change token could not be verifiably placed. Rather than aborting or force-writing a possibly-wrong value, the add degrades to `partial:true` with a `hint` to verify via `hub_get_app_config` and, if needed, write `tstate<N>` (device-state) or `ReltDev<N>` (numeric) via `walkStep`.

Trailing-updateRule failure slots (`addRequiredExpression`, `addTrigger`, `addLocalVariable`, `removeLocalVariable`, bulk `addTriggers`/`addActions`, `patches`, and the action/trigger mutation dispatchers):
- `addRequiredExpression` / `replaceRequiredExpression`: `updateRuleFailed: true` + `expressionNotLive: true` + `updateRuleError: <message>` when the post-commit `updateRule` click is rejected. `success` flips false and `partial` flips true. `repairHints` adds a recovery line pointing at `hub_set_rule(button='updateRule', confirm=true)`. `replaceRequiredExpression` additionally returns `requiredExpressionReplaced:true` on success and `requiredExpressionMissing:true` (success:false) when there is no committed expression to replace.
- `addTrigger`: `updateRuleFailed: true` + `subscriptionsNotLive: true` + `updateRuleError: <message>` with the same `success`/`partial` flip. The trigger row IS in the rule's appSettings but the running rule instance never re-subscribed to its device events -- retry `updateRule` to populate subscriptions.
- `addLocalVariable`: `updateRuleFailed: true` + `variableNotLive: true` + `updateRuleError: <message>` with the same `success`/`partial` flip. The variable IS created on the hub but the rule's action map never re-evaluates against the new variable until updateRule fires -- retry as above.
- `removeLocalVariable`: removes a local variable via RM's `deleteGV`/`delConfirm` wizard, then verifies it left `state.allLocalVars`. A verify miss returns `success: false` + `partial: true` + `repairHints` (the `delConfirm` commit is the fragile step; or the variable is still referenced by an action/expression -- remove those refs first). On a rejected trailing `updateRule`: `updateRuleFailed: true` + `variableNotLive: true` + `updateRuleError: <message>` -- retry as above. List current locals via `hub_list_rule_local_variables` (in `hub_read_rules`).
- `addTriggers` / `addActions` (bulk path): `updateRuleFailed: true` + `subscriptionsNotLive: true` + `updateRuleError: <message>` with the same `success`/`partial` flip. The per-item adds IS committed (triggers/actions arrays still surface on the success-shape keys) but the running rule instance never re-subscribed -- retry as above. This applies only when finalisation was attempted and rejected.
- Bulk early stop (`addTriggers` / `addActions`, create, `replaceActions`, and `patches` including each op's inner list): the first item or op that returns `success:false` or `partial:true` stops the request. Items after the stopping item return `notAttempted:true`, the remaining `updateRule` and Done are not fired, and the result carries `bulkStoppedAfter`, `finalisationNotAttempted:true` and an `error` naming the stopping item. On create, a Required Expression whose re-init `updateRule` was rejected also stops the request, so `bulkStoppedAfter:'requiredExpression'` can arrive together with `updateRuleFailed` + `updateRuleError`. Skipping finalisation is not a rollback: items before the stop remain written, actions self-bake, `replaceActions` has already cleared the old list, and create may already have finalised its trigger and Required Expression sections, so earlier writes can already affect an active rule. On an edit, repair the failed item and add the not-attempted items, or restore `backup.backupKey`; a newly created rule has no pre-operation backup, so repair it or delete and re-create it. Fire `updateRule` once the rule is complete.
- `patches`: `updateRuleFailed: true` + `patchesNotLive: true` + `updateRuleError: <message>` with the same `success`/`partial` flip. The patch ops landed but the rule will not re-evaluate / re-subscribe until updateRule fires -- retry as above. This applies only when finalisation was attempted and rejected.
- `removeTrigger` / `modifyTrigger` / `modifyAction` / `removeAction` / `clearActions` / `replaceActions` / `moveAction`: `updateRuleFailed: true` + `subscriptionsNotLive: true` + `updateRuleError: <message>` with the same `success`/`partial` flip. The mutation IS committed but the rule never re-subscribed -- retry as above.

### deviceId vs deviceIds normalization (all condition writes)

Conditions accept either `deviceIds: [N]` (array) or singular `deviceId: N`; the dispatcher normalizes the singular form to the array RM 5.1 expects in `rDev_<N>`. A bare integer passed where the array is expected bypasses pre-validation and silently stores `{N: null}` (the rule renders but never fires), so prefer `deviceIds`. If both are supplied, `deviceIds` (array) wins. Applies recursively inside nested `subExpression.conditions[]`.

### Action-mutation defensive recovery (clearActions / replaceActions)

The action-clear path commits synchronously, but a thin verify-retry guards against a stuck `state.editAct` or a rare firmware commit lag. If the verify still sees the actions present, the response carries `asyncCommitLikely: true, partial: true` plus a `safeRecovery` block. clearActions adds `stage: 'clearActions.verify_absent', httpWriteStatus: 200, wizardStuck: false` and `actionsRequestedForRemoval` / `actionsStillPresent` / `possibleStateEditAct`. replaceActions, on a late inner-clear, sets `stage: 'replaceActions.clear_committed_late_no_add'`, does NOT attempt the add half (prevents a double-write if the clear did commit), echoes the original specs as `pendingActionsToAdd`, and exposes the inner clear fingerprint via `clearActionsResult`. Recovery for both: call `hub_get_app_config(appId)` to check whether the clear committed -- if the actions are absent it committed (for replaceActions, then call `addAction`/`addActions` with the echoed specs to finish). Do NOT call `cancelTrash`: in trash-confirmation mode it may commit pending deletes rather than abort.''',

        set_rule_create_reference: '''## `hub_set_rule` create reference

### appType options

`appType` selects which class of native app to create. NOTE: this selector belongs to `hub_set_native_app` -- `hub_set_rule` always creates `rule_machine` rules. Default: `rule_machine`.

- `rule_machine` — Rule Machine 5.1 (verified live; the only FULLY-supported type — the others have partial label/config handling).
- `button_controller`, `groups_scenes`, `notifier`, `basic_rule` — registered classic types using the same endpoint family. Other classic SmartApps (e.g. Room Lighting) can be registered in `_appTypeRegistry` to enable creation. `hub_set_native_app` / `hub_delete_native_app` already work on them today via their `appId`.
- Visual Rules are NOT created here — they are Vue-JSON apps; use `hub_set_visual_rule` (see `hub_get_tool_guide(section='visual_rule_reference')`).

### Partial-success protocol

The tool ALWAYS creates the rule shell (you get an `appId` back) even if some triggers/actions fail to fully bake. Inspect the result:

- `partial: true` + `partialTriggers: [N, ...]` / `partialActions: [N, ...]` → some pieces are incomplete (this includes any per-item result with `partial: true` OR `success: false`).
- `repairHints: [...]` → concrete next-step instructions.
- Each per-trigger / per-action result has its own `success`, `partial`, `settingsSkipped`, `repairHints`, and `health` block. `success: true, partial: true` on an inner result means the row was written but needs repair.

The right move when `partial: true` is to follow the `repairHints`, NOT to delete the rule and retry from scratch. Tool-only repair via `hub_set_rule(walkStep={...})` / `replaceActions` / `removeAction` can usually finish the job. Only declare failure after exhausting those repair attempts.''',

        variables: '''## Hub Variables

Reference for the hub-variable tools (hub_get_variable, hub_create_variable, hub_delete_variable, hub_create_connector). Per-tool details below.

### hub_get_variable

The returned `source` field says which one matched (the hub-variable namespace is searched first, then rule-engine variables). For hub variables it also returns metadata: `type`, plus `deviceId`/`attribute` when a connector is linked.

### hub_create_variable

Create a new hub variable (global variable visible to apps and Rule Machine), one at a time or several in one call. Single form: name + type + value.

**Bulk form:**
- `variables=[{name,type,value}, ...]` — mutually exclusive with the single form (i.e. mutually exclusive with `name`/`type`/`value`).
- Bulk items are created sequentially; each succeeds or fails independently and the result reports per-item status.

**Why create first (vs hub_set_variable):**
- Use this before `hub_set_variable` for a name that doesn't exist yet — Hubitat's `setGlobalVar` cannot create, only update.
- Drives the Settings → Hub Variables wizard, since creation isn't exposed via the public app API.

**Constraints:**
- Name must not contain any of these characters: `' " \\ ~ [ : ] < >`. (This applies to the single-form `name` and to each bulk item's `name`.)
- A String variable's initial value must be non-empty (an empty String reports success but never persists).

**Expose to device-only apps:**
- To also expose the variable to device-only apps, follow up with `hub_create_connector`.

### hub_delete_variable

Useful for sweeping orphaned `BAT_E2E_*` artifacts after CI runs, removing stale lease variables, or general cleanup.

**Why the reference-safety refusal matters:** the tool refuses by default when a child rule app references the variable because deletion would silently break those rules — null lookups → false conditions, and a literal `%varname%` left in substitutions. Pass `force=true` to proceed anyway after acknowledging the breakage.

### hub_list_variable_changes

Audit/debug what changed a hub variable and when, without polling hub_get_variable. This durable buffer retains the latest 200 subscribed changes across app and hub restarts. Names are rewritten on variable rename, and sinceMs includes events at the boundary. The hub's separate location-event history is available through hub_list_device_events with no deviceId; its retention and timestamps differ.

### hub_create_connector

For Number/Decimal vars, Hubitat shows a connector-type chooser (Dimmer/Variable/etc.); pass `connectorType` to pick, default `Variable`. For String/Boolean/DateTime vars, the chooser is skipped. The full Number/Decimal `connectorType` set is: Dimmer, Variable, Volume, ColorTemp, Humidity, Illuminance.

        dashboards: '''## Dashboards

Reference for the dashboard tools (hub_list_dashboards, hub_get_dashboard, hub_create_dashboard, hub_update_dashboard, hub_delete_dashboard, hub_clone_dashboard). These cover TWO kinds of dashboard, distinguished by the `type` field every tool reports:

- **Easy Dashboard** (`type: "easy"`) — the modern touch-friendly device dashboard: a device list plus tile toggles, navigation, theme, and optional PINs. Config is replaced wholesale.
- **Legacy Hubitat® Dashboard** (`type: "legacy"`) — the classic, richly-customizable dashboard app: an explicit tile grid you lay out yourself (each tile's position, size, template, plus grid colors and fonts). Edited via a full layout replace or granular tile ops.

Per-tool details below.

### hub_list_dashboards

Read-only; each entry carries id, name, and `type` ('easy' or 'legacy'). Easy entries also include tile/theme config. Resolves the dashboard token automatically, so no pinToken is normally needed.

### hub_get_dashboard

Read-only. For an Easy Dashboard: tiles, navigation, devices, and PINs. For a legacy dashboard: its authorized `deviceIds` plus a nested `layout` object (see "Legacy layout shape" below). Read before the wholesale `hub_update_dashboard` and pass its output straight back. A read that partly fails returns `partial: true` with a note — the missing fields are unavailable, not defaulted.

### hub_create_dashboard

Write op. `type` selects the kind: `easy` (default) or `legacy`.

- **Easy** — needs >=1 device. Tiles default off; theme defaults to `legacy` (the theme name, unrelated to the dashboard kind).

  **`options` (optional config object):**
  - `showModeTile`, `showClockTile`, `showCalendarTile`, `showHSMTile` (bool)
  - `showEdit`, `showNavigation`, `showTutorial` (bool)
  - `navigationSelection`
  - `theme` — one of `legacy` | `light` | `dark` | `auto`
  - `dashboardPin`
  - `hsmPin`
- **Legacy** (`type: "legacy"`) — creates the dashboard with an EMPTY layout (no tiles). `name` is required; `deviceIds` is OPTIONAL and sets the dashboard's authorized-device list (NOT tiles). The `options` arg is REJECTED (Easy-only) — a legacy dashboard's look lives in its layout, set via `hub_update_dashboard` after creation. Requires the built-in "Hubitat® Dashboard" app to be installed.

### hub_update_dashboard

Update by id; the behavior depends on the dashboard's kind.

**Easy Dashboard** — wholesale config replace:
- **Read `hub_get_dashboard` first** and pass the FULL config back; this is a wholesale replace, not a partial patch. `name` and `deviceIds` (>=1) are required; any omitted field (PINs included) reverts to its default.
- `options`: same keys as `hub_create_dashboard.options`.
- Passing any legacy-only arg (`layout`, `setOptions`, `addTiles`, `updateTiles`, `removeTileIds`) at an Easy Dashboard is rejected.

**Legacy Hubitat® Dashboard** — edit the label, devices, and/or layout:
- `name` — renames the dashboard's app label.
- `deviceIds` — wholesale-replaces the authorized-device list.
- Layout edits are EITHER `layout` OR the granular ops, never both:
  - `layout` — a full layout object (as returned by `hub_get_dashboard`), replaced wholesale.
  - Granular ops — `removeTileIds`, `updateTiles`, `addTiles`, `setOptions`. They apply in that fixed order in ONE save: removals → updates → adds → options. All validation runs before the save, so a bad op leaves the layout untouched.
- Retry-safe semantics: `removeTileIds` skips an id that is already gone (with a warning), and `addTiles` skips a tile identical to an existing one (with a warning), so a retried call cannot stack duplicates. An `updateTiles` entry for an unknown tile id throws.
- The `options` arg does NOT apply to legacy — pass grid/color/font fields via `setOptions` instead.
- Result: `applied` (the ops that ran), `tileCount`, the saved `layout` echo, and any `warnings`.

**Legacy layout shape:**
- Top-level fields: `cols`, `rows`, `colWidth`, `rowHeight`, `gridGap`, `bgColor`, `iconSize`, `fontSize`, `customColors`, `roundedCorners`, `hideLabels`, and `tiles`. `setOptions` merges any of the top-level fields (the `tiles` and `name` keys are rejected there).
- Each tile: `id` (integer, auto-assigned max+1 on add), `template`, `device` (a device id), `col`, `row` (1-indexed, top-left cell is col 1 / row 1), `colSpan`, `rowSpan` (default 1), and optional `templateExtra`. `addTiles` requires `template`, `col`, and `row`.
- **Device authorization:** a tile's `device` must be in the dashboard's authorized `deviceIds` or the tile renders empty. Adds/updates referencing an unauthorized device still apply but surface a warning; authorize it via `deviceIds`.
- Tile `template` names: acceleration, attribute, battery, bulb, bulb-color, buttons, carbon-dioxide, carbon-monoxide, clock, clock-analog, clock-date, contact, dashboard, date, dimmer, door, door-control, energy, fan, garage, garage-control, generic, hsm, humidity, illuminance, images, level-step, level-vertical, links, lock, mode, momentary, motion, multi, music-player, outlet, power, presence, relay, scene, shades, shock, smoke, switches, temperature, texttile, thermostat, valve, variable-bool, variable-date, variable-decimal, variable-number, variable-string, variable-time, video-player, volume, water, weather, window.
- **localAccess caveat:** a legacy dashboard with 'Allow LAN access' disabled can block its layout endpoint; reads/writes then report the layout as unavailable and note the LAN-access setting.

### hub_delete_dashboard

Devices are NOT deleted. Write op; needs `confirm=true` + a backup within 24h.

- `confirm` (param) — Confirms a recent backup + user approval.
- A legacy dashboard is removed through the classic force-delete (the Easy `/dashboard/delete` endpoint is a no-op for it); removal is confirmed by effect and the result carries its `type`.

### hub_clone_dashboard

Write op; clone-by-value (the source is never touched).

- **Easy** — copies the source's config into a new dashboard (theme may default).
- **Legacy** — creates a new legacy dashboard with the same authorized devices, then copies the source's layout into it wholesale.

        slow_ops: '''## Slow operations over Streamable HTTP

Hubitat's cloud relay can end one HTTP request while hub-side work continues. MCP 2026-07-28 request-to-request continuation solves this without changing transport, installing an extension, or asking the caller to invent a token.

### Automatic request-to-request continuation

The modern path applies to `hub_set_rule`, `hub_set_native_app`, multi-rule stop/start batches through `hub_call_rule`, `hub_clone_native_app`, `hub_import_native_app`, the slow driver-code lifecycle writes `hub_create_driver`, `hub_update_driver`, and `hub_delete_item(type="driver")`, `hub_delete_debug_logs`, `hub_manage_virtual_device`, and `hub_update_device`. When the transport carries a time budget, device, log and diagnostic reads also continue as described below.

The first write request reserves the operation and starts its first slice at once; a write that finishes within that request's wait budget returns an ordinary `resultType: "complete"` result in one round trip, so a client that never echoes `requestState` still completes fast writes. Only work still running at the budget returns `resultType: "input_required"` with an opaque `requestState`; compatible MCP clients repeat the same tool call with that state, subject to their retry limit. A resumed request either advances work or observes an internal worker within the request's wait budget. Detached workers use a separate 120-second cooperative target at safe batch boundaries; individual wizard operations may exceed it. A terminal `resultType: "complete"` describes the operation's outcome; neither successful completion nor completion within a particular client's retry limit is guaranteed.

The state is bound to the original leaf tool and exact original arguments. A mismatched, unknown, or expired state executes nothing. A fresh identical call while the original is active rejoins that same `requestState` and observes the running owner; every response to that replay is marked `rejoined: true`, and it cannot reserve or run a second write. This lets a client safely replay a first request whose HTTP response was lost while the work is still running. To INTENTIONALLY run the same write twice while the first record is still live, vary the arguments or wait out the record TTL -- a byte-identical repeat always coalesces. The terminal result remains replayable briefly under the same requestState so losing only the final HTTP response does not rerun the operation. A write that completed within its first request has no state the client could echo, so a lost response there is the same exposure as any single-request write: read the target before repeating it. A client that cannot render `input_required` shows a generic client-side error with no result body while the hub keeps running the write; the same rule applies -- read the target, and know that an identical repeat within the active window joins the running write rather than starting a second one.

### Worker checkpoints and limits

Native bulk trigger/action edits, resumable patch batches and walk-driver steps pause between completed items after the worker target. Driver bulk installs/updates pause between drivers. Each saved checkpoint retains the untouched remainder, renews the active window, and advances the owner generation; the next original-argument request with the same state starts a fresh worker slice. If no client request resumes a checkpoint within about five seconds, the server resumes it itself and keeps going to completion or the eight-slice cap, so a client that never continues still gets the whole write; a client request that arrives later observes or replays as usual. Clone and import checkpoints resume the same way (their later phases read only the checkpoint, so the import JSON is not retained). `hub_get_info` returns `recentWrites`: the last ten continuation-eligible writes with their status (`running`, `paused_resuming`, `finished`, `finished_with_error`) and identifiers, so a client that saw only a generic error can learn what happened with one read. Every state-only reply, every background completion and every paused write that expires unresumed is logged in the MCP log (`hub_get_logs` with `mode="mcp"`, component `mrtr`) at info or warn, so a client-side error can be traced without enabling debug logging. Inner destructive wizard operations never receive this worker clock.

Native creation, action replacement, individual driver operations, and patch batches containing `replaceRequiredExpression` remain uninterrupted. Splitting those operations would require additional phase or rollback state. The target is not a hard execution deadline or a guarantee of recovery from a platform kill.

If eight owner slices leave work unfinished, the terminal `continuation_limit` result retains the completed aggregate, exact remaining-work fields and any deferred-finalization guidance. Inspect that result before making a new, smaller call containing only the remainder. Replaying the old state only returns the same terminal result. Native settings may already be written while updateRule/Done remains deferred.

### Client retry limits and resume

The official Python SDK pinned by this project (2.0.0) defaults to ten automatic continuation retries. Contention and worker-coordination responses consume client rounds; the server's `mrtr.rounds` counts owner work slices instead. Its eight-slice cap does not bound a client's retries, and ten retries is an SDK policy, not an MCP requirement. Cloud wait budgets reduce rapid polling but cannot make an arbitrary-duration worker finish within that limit.

For integrations that control the SDK, configure `Client(..., input_required_max_rounds=...)` for the expected operation size, or use `client.session.call_tool(..., allow_input_required=True)` and retain each returned `request_state` before the next request. Resume with the same outer tool, original arguments and exact state; do not send only the remaining arguments. Hubitat keeps one state string for the logical call. The SDK also accepts `client.call_tool(..., request_state=saved_state)` to resume its automatic loop. Choose state capture before starting: `InputRequiredRoundsExceededError` does not contain the last state. A worked example and offline SDK coverage are in `docs/testing.md`, "Client retry policy".

Stopping client retries does not cancel an executing worker or free its write slot. Replaying the saved state retrieves the retained outcome without repeating the write. Retention is finite: idle active records expire after three minutes; executing workers remain protected while their live marker exists; write terminal results expire after ten minutes and may be evicted earlier under record pressure. If state expires or is lost, inspect the actual target before deciding on a new write. A fresh identical call after completion is a NEW operation, not a terminal replay. Clients with an unconfigurable limit cannot be promised completion for arbitrary operation sizes.

### Global write concurrency cap

Every actual write obtains a server-side lease, whether it uses MRTR or completes in one request. `maxConcurrentWrites` defaults to 2 (1 fully serializes writes; 0 disables the cap). A new write at capacity is refused as `too_many_writes_in_flight` before dispatch, so parallel agents or a client burst cannot overwhelm the hub. Active MRTR calls and the background `hub_update_package` worker keep their slot until completion; abandoned leases expire automatically. Reads, gateway catalog calls, schema-only probes, `hub_call_device_replace(list_options=true)`, and `hub_update_package(dryRun=true)` do not count. No client token or extra argument is involved.

### Older clients

Clients negotiated below MCP 2026-07-28 do not understand requestState. They retain the existing `status: "in_progress"` remainder envelope for bounded multi-step writes. Completed steps are already committed; reissue only the returned remaining work. This is a compatibility fallback, not a second polling protocol.

Native log reads through `hub_get_logs` and cold MCP log recovery use the same continuation. Recovery also serves logging status, `hub_get_info`, `hub_report_issue`, and detailed `hub_get_custom_rule` diagnostics. `hub_delete_debug_logs` waits for recovery before clearing and retains its small terminal result for safe replay. Reload recovery reads the existing native history; old state-backed entries are discarded once when updating to native storage. No log content is stored in the continuation record.

`hub_get_device` (every mode), `hub_list_devices` (including virtual devices), and `hub_get_device_health` use background reads on budgeted modern requests. Fast reads finish in one response. Each independent call fetches fresh data; only continuation/replay shares its snapshot, including any device-details pagination cursor. Device access changes or a lost snapshot reject continuation. Device payloads remain in bounded memory, outside persisted continuation records. Legacy device calls remain synchronous. Health retains its 30-second traceroute and 90-second speedtest timeouts, but eight observation slices or a client's retry limit can end the wait before a long probe finishes. A health `slow_read_timeout` does not cancel probes or the optional identify LED blink; do not automatically retry it as a new call.

Two reads use the same continuation: `hub_get_jobs` and `hub_get_performance_stats` both come from the hub's `/logs/json` page, one document that carries every device and app stat plus the job tables, so its fetch time grows with hub size and on a large hub can outrun the relay. When the request's transport has a time budget (`relayBudgetMs` over the cloud relay, `lanBudgetMs` on the LAN) the fetch runs in a background worker and its trimmed result is cached for 30 s; a modern client's first call already runs the read (a cached or quickly landed snapshot answers in one round trip) and only a still-pending fetch hands back `requestState` to continue, a legacy client that receives `status: "in_progress"` repeats the identical call, and a failed fetch is returned as an ordinary `isError` result with a retry already scheduled. Reads never hold a write lease or count toward `maxConcurrentWrites`, and their terminal record carries no payload (a replay re-runs the read from the cache). With no budget on the transport the fetch runs inline and the call is a single ordinary response.

The advanced `relayBudgetMs` setting (default 6000 ms, 0 disables) controls cloud slices. `lanBudgetMs` defaults to 0; set it just below a LAN client's request timeout only when needed.

### Package deployment

`hub_update_package` is intentionally asynchronous instead of MRTR because a full repair can take minutes and recompiles this app. A real call validates and schedules the repair, then immediately returns `status: "in_progress"` with `requestId`. Do not submit it again: the server retains the reservation until that exact worker clears it or a matching terminal `lastSelfDeploy.requestId` proves it finished. Poll `hub_get_info.lastSelfDeploy` until its `requestId` matches; its `success` and `error` fields are the terminal outcome. During normal execution, keep polling rather than retrying the write. If a worker is abandoned, the next write may remove its marker only after the 10-minute recovery lease has expired and no live worker owns it; retry the deploy only after that recovery condition. `dryRun: true` remains synchronous.

### Other writes

No custom operation-token or deployment-job protocol is exposed. If a non-continuation write loses its response, read current hub state before deciding whether it is safe to retry.

// Sub-section registry (issue #392). Four sections carry ~70% of the guide, so a caller after one
// fact -- a Mode condition shape, say -- had to pull all 57 KB of set_rule_reference. This maps each
// oversized parent to narrower keys that hub_get_tool_guide accepts directly; parent keys are
// untouched and still return the whole section.
//
// A sub-key's value is the list of "### " heading PREFIXES it owns inside the parent's markdown.
// A prefix claims EVERY heading it matches (so 'hub_update_app' takes both hub_update_app blocks),
// and the EMPTY list means "owns the preamble" -- the text before the parent's first "### ".
// The invariant ToolGuideSubSectionsSpec enforces: inside one parent, every block is claimed by
// exactly one sub-key, so a new heading owned by nobody -- or by two sub-keys -- fails CI. What it
// canNOT catch is ANNEXATION: a prefix silently swallows any longer heading starting with it, which
// is how 'hub_get_device' already claims hub_get_device_attribute and hub_get_device_health. That is
// deliberate here, but it means the prefix lists below are not an inventory of what each key serves
// -- when you add a "### " heading, check which prefix already matches it.
